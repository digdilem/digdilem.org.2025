    Respawning in UT is random, but depends a lot on the position of your opponent.<br>
    You probably know from teamsay, that each UT map is divided into different zones. For
    example in Tempest there is Westwing, DamageAmp, Rocketroom and Shieldbelt. <br>
    <br>
    <img src="15_teamsay.jpg" hspace="213" width="225" height="21"><br>
    <br>
    The locations in teamsay aren`t the only occasion where these zones are used though, they
    also appear in UT`s respawn code. It`s very very likely, that your opponent spawns in a
    zone you are not in. In fact, if the distance between you and a player start in a
    different zone is higher than 750 unreal units he cannot spawn in your zone at all (As a
    reference, a player model is 78 unreal units tall, has a width of 38 unreal units and
    moves 400 unreal units per second). <br>
    There are some exceptions to this rule though:<br>
    1. You don`t spawn at the same player spawn point twice in a row.<br>
    2. If the player start is in line of sight to your opponent, you won`t spawn there.<br>
    3. Spawntelefragging is impossible in UT, but that`s covered by line of sight anyway.<br>
    <br>
    So these are some basic rules if you want your opponent to spawn at a certain player
    start:<br>
    1. Stay in a different zone.<br>
    2. Stay out of sight.<br>
    3. Stay as far away as possible, at least 750 unreal units<br>
    <br>
    If you are curious about the zones, you can look them up using UnrealEd. All you have to
    do is to load the map you want to see, for example DM-Tempest.unr and then you have to
    click on the last symbol in one of the windows, which is called &quot;Zone/Portal&quot;. <br>

    from above the shieldroom in zoneview&quot;</strong></font><br>
    <br>
    To put it in a nutshell, if you know the zones you can often predict where the guy you
    just killed respawns.<br><br>
