### Digital Dilemma / digdilem / Flash / Flasheart / Simon Avery

 {{< figure src="simon.jpg" alt="Simon" width="100px" >}}  *An old geek from Dartmoor* 

I've been a labourer, tree surgeon, van driver, maintenance worker, fundraiser and managing director of a horse charity. 

Currently I'm a Linux Sysadmin happily working for a Sports company in Exeter, England. 

I have always been a geek, and fairly recently self-diagnosed as Autistic. This follows an early formal diagnosis of Dyslexia. Re-evaluating my life with this information has led to a lot of "Of course!" moments...

#### Programming and computer experience
* 1980s: **BASIC, Quill, Adlan, GAC** *A fun time and the 8-bit Text Adventure scene in Britain at that time was lively and exciting. I sold several games, mostly through WoW Software. (RIP Joan)*
* 1990s: **TADS, Borland Turbo-C**  *I ran a BBS for over a decade, and much of my C coding was developing tools for that.*
* 2000s: **Perl, PHP, Bootstrap, SQL** *At this point I was asked to write a database to manage the horses for an equine charity. This evolved into a major CRM that grew with the charity until it was managing close to a thousand horses, 150 staff and all the inter-relationships. This was written entirely in Perl CGI, using MySql as a backend*
* 2010s: **Bash, Python, lots more perl and SQL**

In the late 90s, I made a major career change and was lucky enough to get a job with a great employer as a Linux Sysadmin. All my adult life I'd lived in awe of these super beings, and suddenly I was one. Imposter syndrome was huge and the learning curve was steep!

* 2020s: Linux, specialising in EL (Centos, RHEL, Rocky), Debian. MariaDb administration. Uyuni. Grafana. PRTG. Zabbix. Docker and the dozens of other stacks that sysadmins need to know. 


#### Hobbies:

* DIY, land maintenance.
* Home Automation, mostly using a very large and completely unnecessary Home Assistant setup.
* Walking, Cycling, Geocaching *Since some heart trouble, this is now less*
* Motorcycling with the occasional easy green lane.
* Vehicle maintenance and restoring old vehicles.

* I have a [Github page](https://github.com/digdilem)
* I maintain a number of [Dartmoor related websites](/dartmoor/)
