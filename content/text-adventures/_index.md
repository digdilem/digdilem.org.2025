Text Adventures

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, I was a part of the thriving British Text Adventure scene and as well as enjoying many such games, I wrote a few too. Many of these were sold through Joan Pancott’s “Witch of Wessex Software” company, some through The Guild Software. Some were released as public domain / freeware. They were written for 8-bit and 16-bit computers such as the Amstrad CPC, and ported to Spectrum and C64, with later ones written for the PC.
