    This guide wouldn`t have been possible without the help of the following people:<br>
    NUB=Garfield, who helped me A LOT with everything sourcecode related. Without him you
    would see lots of expressions like &quot;I think&quot;, &quot;my experience shows&quot; or
    &quot;approximately&quot; in this guide, cause only he gave me all the facts about UT.
    Especially his work on the weapon stats has been great.<br>
    <br>
    [NewNet]Sloci_da_Voievode, who was responsible for all the html and the logo. A wonder,
    that he made something readable, even something with a nice design out of my txt-file mess
    (-;<br>
    <br>
    All the players from my clan Ocrana for beta testing.<br>
    <br>
    ...and last but not least Epic for making Unreal Tournament<br>
