    There is a gameplay bug in UT, that has quite an impact on the game, especially in duels.<br>
    Because Epic didn`t fix this bug yet, although they know of it since version 405, I
    started to look at it as a feature, not a bug. Of course murphy`s law dictates, that Epic
    will fix it now.<br>
    Anyway, using this feature you can have up to 50 points more armor, than the maximum of
    150, which means 33% more armor!<br>
    The bug is simple. You`ve got a shield and get wounded, for example down to 80 shield. Now
    if you take the armor you get 150 - 80 = 70 armor, so you have 150 again, 80 shield and 70
    armor. If you also take the thigh pads with this armor status you shouldn`t get any
    additional armor. But that`s where the shield-bug comes into play. If you have shield and
    armor, only the shield will be counted when picking up pads. So you get an additional 50
    armor. All in all you have 80 shield, 70 armor and 50 pads now, which makes a total of 200
    armor. The hud will still show 150, but if you get wounded you can see that the 1st 50
    damage won`t be substracted. This also works, if you take pads before armor.<br>
    Your shield should be down to 50-100 points, when picking up armor/pads, for optimal
    results. Here is a graph, that shows why:<br>

    extra armor is depending on the shield status&quot;</strong></font><br>
    <br>
    If you couldn`t follow me with that explanation, here is in short what you have to do:<br>
    1. get shield<br>
    2. get wounded or wound yourself down to 50-100 shield<br>
    3. get armor<br>
    4. get pads<br>
    <br>
    The chronological order of 3 and 4 can be changed.<br>
    <br>
    It`s not easy to take advantage of this bug, but those 50 points more armor can be the
    difference between life and death, sometimes at least (-;<br>
    <br>
    Of course this only works in maps with shield, armor and pads, so it comes down to Turbine
    and Deck16 in duels.<br><br>
