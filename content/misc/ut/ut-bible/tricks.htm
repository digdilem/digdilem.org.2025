    In UT there are 3 main physic tricks you can take advantage of.<br>
    One of these is the elevator jump. If you jump on an elevator, the elevator speed is added
    to the jump speed, so you jump much higher than usually. This is especially popular in
    Deck16, where you can jump up at the armor, even though the elevator is only half-way up.
    This is also how you can jump from the elevator to the sniper rifle in Codex, or from the
    main elevator in Curse to the middle bridge.<br>
    The next trick is only possible with dodging and only if there are non-vertical walls. If
    you dodge against such a wall your sidespeed is converted to upspeed, so you can reach
    higher places, than when jumping normally. Especially useful is this trick in Curse, where
    there are lots of non-vertical walls. You can jump up to the healthpacks/secret ammo room
    near the flak from amp for example. But this is also useful in Liandri for example, where
    you can dodge up to the Bio Rifle when coming from the flak.<br>
    The last physic trick is the Impact Hammer jump, I already mentioned. Just look down to
    the floor, while loading your Impact Hammer in primary fire, then jump and release the
    fire at the same time. You will jump much higher than usually at the cost of 54 health.
    You can also jump with the secondary fire. You will only lose 13h, but you won`t jump as
    high. This is perfect for the jump to the amp in Turbine. <br>
    This works with every weapon, that has splash damage. But the Impact hammer has the best
    damage/height efficiency. The only occasion where I would use a different weapon is, if
    you spawn at the ASMD in Turbine and try to get shield as fast as possible. The fastest
    method is to open the shieldroom with an ASMD primary and immediately jump up with an ASMD
    secondary jump. <br>
