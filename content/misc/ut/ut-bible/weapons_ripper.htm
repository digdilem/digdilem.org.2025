    The Ripper is mainly a weapon for spamming. In primary mode it shoots projectiles, that
    are reflected from floor and walls 6 times, so you can shoot around corners. If they hit a
    player in the upper third of the playermodel the hit is counted as a headshot inflicting
    more than 3 times the normal damage, so you should always aim for the head. The ripper
    headshot has the biggest damage/second potential, but it´s mainly a matter of luck if you
    manage to hit.<br>
    <br>
    The secondary fire mode shoots explosive projectiles, just like the rockets. Their big
    advantage is, that they are much faster than rockets, but with almost the same splash
    radius and a faster rate of fire, so this mode is best used to knock a player around by
    shooting at their feets. The ripper secondary only inflicts less than half the damage of a
    rocket though, so you should only use the ripper in this mode if there are no other
    weapons available.<br>
    <br>
    All in all the Ripper is mainly a weapon, for FFA where you can make lots of frags by just
    spamming with the Razor Blades. It´s rarely used in duel.<br>
