*I bought it but I put the original back after only one ride…*

The stock 2023 Himalayan is a great bike, but head and body wind protection is pretty minimal. Having come from a BMW R1200GS with an amazing Givi Airflow screen, I missed being able to ride with an open helmet at everything other than motorway speeds, so went shopping.

The only really affordable option I found was the Puig Touring screen, available Clear, tinted or smoked. So I paid £110 to the cheapest decent ebay supplier and bought it. It turned up a few days later, not very well packaged but was undamaged and still in original packaging.

Fitting was simple – screens are held on with four small bolts and it’s just a case of unscrewing them and putting them back on. I have an accessory bar also sharing these holes for my phone, but that doesn’t affect mounting at all.

Here’s what it looked like when mounted:

### Problem 1

I was happy with that, but I had noticed that the screen moves a lot. That wide bit acts like a natural hinge and despite the plastic being reasonably thick, I could move the top of the screen back with my finger and very little pressure about an inch.

### Problem 2

So I hopped on and put the bike on full lock as I turned to leave my home. The mirrors hit the screen! I will admit that my left mirror is on an extension bar, but the right hand mirror is entirely stock. BOTH mirrors hit the screen at full lock. This is terrible! Not only does it risk damaging the screen. Not only did it push one mirror back out of alignment. But it’s also dangerous for it to interfere with the steering. That’s a part of the MOT check for British bikes so it could actually fail a safety inspection.

### Problem 3

I’m 6’2″ tall, so I expected some buffetting on the stock screen. Somehow, this taller screen actually made that worse! It redirected air that was previously hitting me in the chest and pointed it right at my head, increasing buffetting. It actually lowered the speed where I closed my visor from around 40mph to 30mph, and I didn’t need any lunch after an hour’s riding because I’d eaten so many flies!

So, in all, a very disappointing purchase. I replaced the original screen as soon as I got back from that ride.
