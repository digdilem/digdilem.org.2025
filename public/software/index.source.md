My Software

## Text Adventures

*During the late 1980s and early 1990s, I was a part of the thriving British Text Adventure scene and as well as enjoying many such games, I wrote a few too. Many of these were sold through Joan Pancott's "Witch of Wessex Software" company. Some were freeware. These were written for 8-bit and 16-bit computers, with later ones running on PC.*

* [A collection of my Text Adventures for various formats can be found on my github page](https://github.com/digdilem/textadventures)

## IRC Scripts

*A selection of various IRC scripts, most of which were written to work with XChat (Now replaced by HexChat) as well as Irssi and Eggdrop. They ranged from fun, silly, stupid, useful and very useful. 2000s to 2010s*

## Fidonet Software

*Various pieces of freeware / Public Domain software I wrote during the early 1990s for Fidonet or Public Domain in Borland Turbo C*

## IP Camera Database

*A list of IP Cameras with some useful paths and details to help them integrate with CCTV software, notably [Zoneminder](https://zoneminder.com/) - Early 2000s. This hasn't been updated for years but may still be useful for old cameras*
