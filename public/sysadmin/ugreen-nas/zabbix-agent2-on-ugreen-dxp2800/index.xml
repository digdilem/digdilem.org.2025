    <title>Zabbix Agent2 on Ugreen Dxp2800 :: Digital Dilemma</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/sysadmin/ugreen-nas/zabbix-agent2-on-ugreen-dxp2800/index.html</link>
    <description>I recently got a new NAS, a UGreen DXP2800, and wanted to add it to me existing Zabbix Server to monitor disk space and get alerts when I was running low. I couldn’t find much information about how to do this, so I wrote this for those who follow after.&#xA;The Ugreen DXP 2800&#xA;Whilst you can mount in each network share into an existing machine that already has a Zabbix Agent running, I wanted to run the agent on the NAS itself - it is just a linux server, after all.</description>
