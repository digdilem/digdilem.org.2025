    <title>Flash&#39;s guide for Domination newbies... :: Digital Dilemma</title>
    <link>https://digdilem.org/misc/ut/domination/index.html</link>
    <description>Written some time in the early 2000’s to try and encourage UT players into the Domination mod –Flash, 2025&#xA;Intended for them’s who can play UT, insta or nw, but who don’t know&#xA;much about the DOM mod.&#xA;Server Rules: (Normal CB stuff and what most clans use) 5 v 5. 20 mins per map. No score cap. 2 maps. FF = 0% WS = ON Redeemer = OFF Translocator = ON Intro: Dom is a great mod. A bit like defending in CTF. When played with nw&#xA;then trans-whoring is essential and spam is rife - it’s by far the&#xA;spammiest mod in UT. It’s non-stop action with lots of little tricks&#xA;and has all the range of skill levels playing. All weapons have their&#xA;place and the pace means you use what you’ve got.</description>
