    <meta name="description" content="UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - NewsWeapons - Impact Hammer (Piston)Damage/hitmax. 135h, increases linear when charging   primary30h                                                       secondaryRange90uu, auto release range 60uuprimary180uusecondaryTime until charged:   2s, auto release after 1.33s primaryRate:1.35/ssecondaryDamage/s:68hprimary41hsecondaryThis is UT�s melee weapon, meant to be the last option to defend yourselfif you are out of ammo. If charged it can do a nice amount of damage, after 1.5secs youcan already kill someone with 100h and the maximum 135 damage after 2 secs isn`t badeither. This doesn�t make up for the vulnerability while running arround with this thingthough. Not only that it�s making very loud noises when charged, but you also have to getvery close to hit your opponent and even with dodging this is sometimes impossible,especially in open areas.
The only places where the piston is a good choice as a weapon is in very tight corridors(like in turbine) at the top/bottom of an elevator or behind a teleporter. In a duel Iwould only use it in the last case, because you don�t take any risks behind a tele. Youropponent doesn�t hear you through the teleporter and you can retreat through the tele ifhe is coming from behind.
Although it�s not that useful as a weapon, I still wouldn�t play without it, becauseit�s an essential tool to reach high places. This is done by hammer jumping, somethingvery similar to rocket jumping in Quake. You charge the impact hammer, point it towardsthe ground and jump while releasing it in the floor. You will jump much higher thannormally, but always lose 54 health, so you should only use it if you have nothing to loseor in very important situations, like jumping up to the shield/rl in codex or getting thesniper rifle and heightadvantage in Liandri. To repeat it, you will ALWAYS get 54 healthself damage, no matter how long you charged, but your impulse increases linear, so if youhave enough time you should charge the full 2 seconds to jump as high as possible.
You should also be aware, that you are very vulnerable while impact jumping. After all ittakes 800ms to switch to a different weapon.
Something else you can do with the impact hammer is deflecting rockets, if you use thesecondary fire just the moment the rocket would hit you. I have never seen someone usingthis in a real game though, if you have enough time to do this, you could as well dodgethe rocket. Besides that most rockets are aimed for the ground anyway.
