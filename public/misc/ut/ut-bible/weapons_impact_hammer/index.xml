    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News&#xD;Weapons - Impact Hammer (Piston)&#xD;Damage/hit&#xD;max. 135h, increases linear when charging   primary&#xD;30h&#xD;                                                       &#xD;secondary&#xD;Range&#xD;90uu, auto release range 60uu&#xD;primary&#xD;180uu&#xD;secondary&#xD;Time until charged:   2s, auto release after 1.33s primary&#xD;Rate:&#xD;1.35/s&#xD;secondary&#xD;Damage/s:&#xD;68h&#xD;primary&#xD;41h&#xD;secondary&#xD;This is UT�s melee weapon, meant to be the last option to defend yourself&#xD;if you are out of ammo. If charged it can do a nice amount of damage, after 1.5secs you&#xD;can already kill someone with 100h and the maximum 135 damage after 2 secs isn`t bad&#xD;either. This doesn�t make up for the vulnerability while running arround with this thing&#xD;though. Not only that it�s making very loud noises when charged, but you also have to get&#xD;very close to hit your opponent and even with dodging this is sometimes impossible,&#xD;especially in open areas.&#xA;The only places where the piston is a good choice as a weapon is in very tight corridors&#xD;(like in turbine) at the top/bottom of an elevator or behind a teleporter. In a duel I&#xD;would only use it in the last case, because you don�t take any risks behind a tele. Your&#xD;opponent doesn�t hear you through the teleporter and you can retreat through the tele if&#xD;he is coming from behind.&#xA;Although it�s not that useful as a weapon, I still wouldn�t play without it, because&#xD;it�s an essential tool to reach high places. This is done by hammer jumping, something&#xD;very similar to rocket jumping in Quake. You charge the impact hammer, point it towards&#xD;the ground and jump while releasing it in the floor. You will jump much higher than&#xD;normally, but always lose 54 health, so you should only use it if you have nothing to lose&#xD;or in very important situations, like jumping up to the shield/rl in codex or getting the&#xD;sniper rifle and heightadvantage in Liandri. To repeat it, you will ALWAYS get 54 health&#xD;self damage, no matter how long you charged, but your impulse increases linear, so if you&#xD;have enough time you should charge the full 2 seconds to jump as high as possible.&#xA;You should also be aware, that you are very vulnerable while impact jumping. After all it&#xD;takes 800ms to switch to a different weapon.&#xA;Something else you can do with the impact hammer is deflecting rockets, if you use the&#xD;secondary fire just the moment the rocket would hit you. I have never seen someone using&#xD;this in a real game though, if you have enough time to do this, you could as well dodge&#xD;the rocket. Besides that most rockets are aimed for the ground anyway.&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt;&#xD;back | top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;&#xD;       Unreal&#xD;Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other&#xD;tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
