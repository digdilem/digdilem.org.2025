    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News Weapons - Enforcer Damagehit:   max. 25h   Rate: 2.8/s primary 3.8/s secondary Inaccuracy: 0.5 degree primary Rate: 1.1 degree, increrasing up to 9.6 degrees secondary Damage/s: 70h primary 95h secondary The impact hammer and the enforcer are the only weapons you will have right after spawning. With this weapon spawners are no easy target at all. Not only that it is very accurate and instant hit, but it�s firing rate is only matched by the minigun. Especially in secondary mode (less accurate, but higher firing rate) this is a very strong weapon, killing someone with 100 health in only 1 second if every bullet hits. Although you shouldn�t underestimate the enforcer you should still go for a different weapon after respawning, because most other weapons are even stronger and you are very vulnerable when shooting with the enforcer, because you have to be in line of sight with your opponent.&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back | top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;        Unreal Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
