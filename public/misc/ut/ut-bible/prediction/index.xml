    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News&#xD;Prediction&#xD;In a duel prediction is everything. It`s always about trying to figure out where your&#xD;opponent is, with what his health/armor/weapon status is and what he is going to do. This&#xD;is simply said the main key to success.&#xA;There are 3 different kinds of prediction.&#xA;1st level prediction is used in fights, mainly with non-instant hit weapons like RL and&#xD;ASMD (secondary). With these weapons you shouldn�t shoot where your opponent is, but&#xD;where he will be when the projectile impacts. Trying to predict this position is 1st level&#xD;prediction.&#xA;2nd level prediction is prediction on sight. You see your opponent going into a hallway&#xD;with only 2 entrances for example. You can predict when he will come out at the other side&#xD;using the player speed as a reference.&#xA;3rd level prediction is a bit more tricky. It`s based on sounds, upcoming events, like&#xD;shield/armor respawn or the last known status of your opponent, if he is low on health, he&#xD;will be going for health packs for example. Or if he took the last shield/armor, you can&#xD;be pretty sure, that he will come back for the next one. More generally said, it`s based&#xD;on logical thinking. During the match you always have to ask yourself &#34;Where could he&#xD;be?&#34; and &#34;What is he up to?&#34;. To get the answers to those questions is mainly a matter of practice, map knowledge and&#xD;quick thinking.&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back&#xD;| top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;&#xD;       Unreal&#xD;Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other&#xD;tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
