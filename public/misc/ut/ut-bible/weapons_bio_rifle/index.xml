    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News&#xD;Weapons - Bio Rifle&#xD;Damage/hit:   60h   primary direct hit&#xD;481.5h  secondary direct hit&#xD;Rate:&#xD;3.84/s&#xD;primary&#xD;Time until charged:  4.1s&#xD;secondary&#xD;Splash radius:&#xD;150uu&#xD;primary&#xD;Damage/s:&#xD;230h&#xD;primary&#xD;117h&#xD;secondary&#xD;The bio rifle behaves a bit like a grenade launcher. It shoots green slime, flying in a a&#xD;ballistic curve towards the ground. But unlike grenades the green slime sticks to the&#xD;ground and the walls, exploding if you shoot at it with an explosive weapon, when getting&#xD;in contact with a player or after 4 seconds,&#xA;With the secondary fire you can charge the weapon up, so that you shoot a big slime ball,&#xD;that collapses into 10 smaller ones (you also need 10 ammo). This weapon is often&#xD;underestimated, because it�s not easy to hit with it, but if you hit with a big secondary&#xD;slime ball your opponent is dead, even if he had 199 health and 150 armor.&#xA;The big advantage of the bio rifle compared to the other chargeable weapons (piston and&#xD;RL) is that you don�t emit any additional sounds once it is charged, so you can ambush&#xD;your opponent. You shouldn�t get too close though, because like with every explosive&#xD;weapon there is a splash effect, fully charged as big as that of a combo, so you can&#xD;easily kill yourself. But sometimes even that is a good option, as long as you take your&#xD;opponent with you, kamikaze style.&#xA;With the primary fire you can inflict a lot of damage/second, but it`s not easy to hit,&#xD;not even on close distance. The primary mode is much more useful to block an entrance, an&#xD;elevator or a teleporter exit for a short time or to retreat around corners shooting goo.&#xA;All in all this is a very specialised, tactical gun, I wouldn�t use it in a normal&#xD;gunfight.&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back&#xD;| top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;&#xD;       Unreal&#xD;Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other&#xD;tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
