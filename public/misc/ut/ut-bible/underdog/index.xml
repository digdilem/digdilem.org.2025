    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News&#xD;Underdog&#xD;Being the underdog&#xA;But what if your opponent has control over armor and shield?&#xA;He will have an armor advantage, so you should avoid direct fights, don�t take any risks.&#xD;If you run towards him and start shooting you can as well type suicide in the console.&#xA;All you can do now is to slowly wear his armor down. There are several ways to do that. You can snipe him from the distance.&#xA;You can shoot around corners with Flak/Grenades/Ripper.&#xA;You can do guess shots with the ASMD/RL.&#xA;Something else you can do is wait for him to get you. You should wait somewhere where you&#xD;have positional advantage, for example at the top of an elevator or at a position with&#xD;height advantage.&#xA;You could also sneak to the armor once he leaves it or wait for him at the shield with a&#xD;defensive weapon like ASMD/RL/Flak.&#xA;A bit more risky is to try ambushing him. He will have to go from armor to shield and back&#xD;to armor once a minute (Phase I and III), that�s where you try to get him. You just hide&#xD;somewhere between armor and shield and as soon as he runs by you shoot him in the back&#xD;with a strong weapon like Flak, Bio Rifle, Sniper, ASMD or RL. If he is a good player though he will know the hiding places and make guess shots. That�s&#xD;why it�s such risky, if that happens you are dead meat. But if you are able to surprise&#xD;him you can easily kill him. 6 flak shrapnels in his back, a combo, a big slimeball or a&#xD;sniper hit and his shield is gone, so you just have to finish him of or retreat to the&#xD;armor/shield, whatever respawns next.&#xA;Most important is that you still keep track of the shield respawn times, even if you&#xD;don�t get it. You could for example wait somewhere near the shield, to hear the pickup&#xD;sound or you just substract another 55 seconds to the last spawn time, pretending, that he&#xD;picked up the shield just as it spawned and calculate with that time.&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back&#xD;| top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;&#xD;       Unreal&#xD;Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other&#xD;tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
