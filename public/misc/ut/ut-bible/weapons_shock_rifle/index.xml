    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News&#xD;Weapons - Shock Rifle&#xD;Damage/hit:   60h&#xD;primary&#xD;82.5h&#xD;secondary&#xD;247.5h&#xD;combo&#xD;Rate:&#xD;1,4/s&#xD;primary&#xD;2,1/s&#xD;secondary&#xD;0,85/s&#xD;combo&#xD;Splash radius:   70uu&#xD;secondary&#xD;250&#xD;combo&#xD;Damage/s:&#xD;84h&#xD;primary&#xD;172h&#xD;secondary&#xD;210h&#xD;combo&#xD;The ASMD is a great all around weapon. It doesn�t really have any decent weaknesses,&#xD;but it also isn�t specialised on anything, so the specialised weapons are usually the&#xD;better choice.&#xA;In long range fights you can use it�s primary mode just like you would use the sniper&#xD;rifle, but it�s by far not as good as the sniper rifle, because it inflicts only a bit&#xD;more damage/second than the enforcer and the rifle has twice the rate of fire. It`s big&#xD;knockback is the only advantage in long range.&#xA;In mid-range combats the ASMD is a much better choice, especially when using combos, but&#xD;in mid range RL, Flak, Pulse and the minigun are superior in most situations.&#xA;When fighting close range you can use the secondary fire, which is often even better than&#xD;rockets, especially when retreating, because of it�s fire rate, but can�t match a flak,&#xD;minigun or pulse.&#xA;When it comes to prediction though the ASMD really excells. You can make a combo anywhere&#xD;you want, no matter if your opponent is on a platform above you or about to come around a&#xD;corner. Of course a rocket sixpack does more damage, but it also takes much longer to&#xD;prepare, whereas The ASMD is always ready to fire a combo and you can fire 2 combos in&#xD;quick succession, which is something that can�t be done with multirockets. If it is close&#xD;enough to the player a combo is even sufficient to kill someone with 100 armor.&#xA;While doing combos you are often very vulnerable though, because the most easy way to do a&#xD;combo is to only move towards the secondary fire ball or away from it and that makes you&#xD;very predictable, as you usually shoot the secondary fire ball in the direction of your&#xD;opponent.&#xA;A really cool advantage of the ASMD is that you won�t have lots of ammo problems. Because&#xD;of the 20 shock cores that come with the ASMD you just have to drop the weapon and pick it&#xD;up again if you are low on ammo. 20 ammo should last a while if you don�t combo too often&#xD;(a combo consumes 4 ammo).&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back&#xD;| top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;&#xD;       Unreal&#xD;Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other&#xD;tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
