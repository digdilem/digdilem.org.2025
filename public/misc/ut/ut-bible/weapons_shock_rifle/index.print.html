It doesn�t really have any decent weaknesses,but it also isn�t specialised on anything, so the specialised weapons are usually thebetter choice.
In long range fights you can use it�s primary mode just like you would use the sniperrifle, but it�s by far not as good as the sniper rifle, because it inflicts only a bitmore damage/second than the enforcer and the rifle has twice the rate of fire. It`s bigknockback is the only advantage in long range.
In mid-range combats the ASMD is a much better choice, especially when using combos, butin mid range RL, Flak, Pulse and the minigun are superior in most situations.
When fighting close range you can use the secondary fire, which is often even better thanrockets, especially when retreating, because of it�s fire rate, but can�t match a flak,minigun or pulse.
When it comes to prediction though the ASMD really excells. You can make a combo anywhereyou want, no matter if your opponent is on a platform above you or about to come around acorner. Of course a rocket sixpack does more damage, but it also takes much longer toprepare, whereas The ASMD is always ready to fire a combo and you can fire 2 combos inquick succession, which is something that can�t be done with multirockets. If it is closeenough to the player a combo is even sufficient to kill someone with 100 armor.
While doing combos you are often very vulnerable though, because the most easy way to do acombo is to only move towards the secondary fire ball or away from it and that makes youvery predictable, as you usually shoot the secondary fire ball in the direction of youropponent.
A really cool advantage of the ASMD is that you won�t have lots of ammo problems. Becauseof the 20 shock cores that come with the ASMD you just have to drop the weapon and pick itup again if you are low on ammo. 20 ammo should last a while if you don�t combo too often(a combo consumes 4 ammo).
