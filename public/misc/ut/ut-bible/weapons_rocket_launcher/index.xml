    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News&#xD;Weapons - Rocket Launcher&#xD;Damagehit:   112,5h   primary&#xD;120h&#xD;secondary&#xD;Splash radius:   220uu&#xD;primary&#xD;200uu&#xD;secondary&#xD;Rate:&#xD;1,2/s&#xD;time to load x rockets/grenades: (x-1) /1,2   Damage/s:&#xD;135h&#xD;primary&#xD;144h&#xD;secondary&#xD;The Rocket Launcher is UT�s RPG-style weapon. Although such a weapon&#xD;exists in almost every shooter the UT RL is very different to the RL of other games. The&#xD;main difference is that you can shoot up to 6 rockets at once, so you can potentially&#xD;inflict 672 damage in one shot, killing everything in your way. The rockets are very slow&#xD;though, so it isn�t the killerweapon you would expect at first glance.&#xA;Besides shooting rockets the RL can shoot grenades, also up to 6 at once. But the grenades&#xD;aren�t as important as in other games, because there are several weapons that shoot&#xD;around corners in UT. Besides that, the grenades accelerate while flying, so it`s&#xD;difficult to predict where they will hit.&#xA;If you have loaded up 6 rockets/grenades, the rl will automatically shoot. The only way to&#xD;prevent that is to drop the rl while loading up. If you are running forward you will even&#xD;pick it up at once again, so you just have to switch back, but the ammo is gone.&#xA;There are basically 2 options to use the rocket launcher. You can load up rockets, shoot at the position of your opponent and retreat. Or you can&#xD;use it as a defensive weapon, by retreating and loading up, so that nobody is able to&#xD;follow without eating enough rockets to get killed or to retreat. Although it�s not the&#xD;fine english style this is a good way to keep a frag lead, waiting for the time to run&#xD;out.&#xA;The 2nd option is to use single rockets (aka instant rockets), which should be prefered&#xD;for infights and for spamming. Maybe you heard the rumor, that you can shoot instant&#xD;rockets faster, but that`s only half-way true. The truth is, that it`s easier to shoot&#xD;them fast. If you keep pressing fire you shoot a rocket exactly the moment, when the RL is&#xD;reloaded. If you are using multirockets instead you have to do this manually and therefore&#xD;there is a short delay, at least if you are human.&#xA;When using rockets it is always a good idea not to shoot at your opponent, but using the&#xD;floor and the walls for splash damage. Like that you won�t hit him with the full damage,&#xD;but you will hit him for sure, which is not the case when going for direct hits.&#xA;Basically you should always try to aim at your opponents feet. If you hit him well he will&#xD;fly a bit in the air because of the explosion knockback, therefore he can�t evade your&#xD;next rocket and if he survives that then he is in the air again waiting for your 3rd&#xD;rocket. Something else to keep in mind is that you shouldn�t shoot at the position where your&#xD;opponent is with the RL, shoot at the position where he will be when the rocket impacts.&#xD;Of course this is easy to say, but with enough practice and a bit logic thinking it is&#xD;possible. By logic thinking I mean thoughts like &#34;He is low on health, he will try to&#xD;escape&#34;, so your next rocket is flying towards the exit of the room.&#xA;The RL is also a good prediction weapon, the only thing that`s better than shooting a&#xD;rocket towards a corner, where you expect your opponent to come around in the next few&#xD;seconds, is shooting 2 or more rockets (-;&#xA;The RL is a weapon that is really difficult to master, especially when it comes to single&#xD;rockets. But it�s also very rewarding if you know how to use it.&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back&#xD;| top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;&#xD;       Unreal&#xD;Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other&#xD;tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
