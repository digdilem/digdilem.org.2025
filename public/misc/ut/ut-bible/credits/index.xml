Without him you&#xD;would see lots of expressions like &#34;I think&#34;, &#34;my experience shows&#34; or&#xD;&#34;approximately&#34; in this guide, cause only he gave me all the facts about UT.&#xD;Especially his work on the weapon stats has been great.&#xA;[NewNet]Sloci_da_Voievode, who was responsible for all the html and the logo. A wonder,&#xD;that he made something readable, even something with a nice design out of my txt-file mess&#xD;(-;&#xA;All the players from my clan Ocrana for beta testing.&#xA;...and last but not least Epic for making Unreal Tournament&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back&#xD;| top&#xD;       Unreal&#xD;Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other&#xD;tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
