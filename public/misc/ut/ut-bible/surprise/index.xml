    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News&#xD;Surprise&#xD;So now that you know about prediction you have to learn methods to make you unpredictable.&#xD;An armor advantage is fine, but in UT getting the 1st shot is more important in most&#xD;situations.&#xA;It`s not that easy to be unpredictable, especially if you got control. You have to be at&#xD;the shield/armor exactly at it`s respawn time, so that doesn`t leave you much room to do&#xD;something unexpected. What you can do though is scout the area first. Especially if you&#xD;still have enough armor, you don`t need to take shield/armor immediately, just guard it&#xD;and search all the ambush places nearby. Picking up the shield doesn`t help if you get a&#xD;headshot immediately after taking it. Sometimes the better option is to let your opponent&#xD;take it, so he will be predictable. You should never go straight for the shield/armor if&#xD;you don`t know where your opponent is or you will be wish you wouldn`t have taken it. This&#xD;is why you should go for the shield/armor in time and without getting distracted too much.&#xA;You should also try to use different routes each time you go from armor to shield or back.&#xA;Faking is a very important tactic as well, just fake going somewhere, but take a different&#xD;direction. You can for example make an elevator go up, but without you on it. Or you can&#xD;go into a hallway, but turn around and take a different way, if your opponent saw you. Or&#xD;you can start picking up health vials, but then retreat and wait for your opponent to&#xD;come, so you are the one to surprise him.&#xA;For the underdog it`s very easy to use the surprise element, cause you know where the guy&#xD;in control will show up and you should also have a rough idea, when that happens. Or you&#xD;could just hide along one of the routes or feign death somewhere and then attack from the&#xD;back.&#xA;There are hundreds of possibilities, show your creativity.&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back&#xD;| top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;&#xD;       Unreal&#xD;Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other&#xD;tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
