    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News&#xD;Dodging&#xD;Dodging in Unreal and Unreal Tournament is a sort of Equivalent to Bunnyjumping in QW and&#xD;Strafejumping in Q2/Q3/CS. Experienced players can go around the map much faster using&#xD;this technique, because the dodgespeed is 600 unreal units per second, which is 1.5 times&#xD;the normal movement speed. Something you should know is, that the velocity component vertical to your dodge move&#xD;isn`t changed, so the fastest method is to walk forward/backward, but dodge sideways, or&#xD;the opposite of that. This means, that you walk forward for example, then do an&#xD;approximately 56 degree turn to the left (arctan(1.5)) and dodge right as fast as&#xD;possible, so that you build up as few velocity to the right as possible before dodging.                                                              &#xD;&#34;dodging done right&#34;&#xA;After dodging you turn back until you can dodge again. Like this you can build up a&#xD;theoretical maximum of 721 unreal units per second opposed to the 600 uu/s when dodging&#xD;normally and 400 uu/s, when running.&#xA;I have recorded a demo to show what I am talking about.&#xA;You should also learn to make use of height differences. While in the air there is no&#xD;friction, so you keep the high speed gained from dodging. That`s why someone who runs up a&#xD;hill and dodges down is faster, than a player running straight forward.&#xA;Unlike Bunnyjumping/Strafejumping dodging can also be very useful in fights. You can&#xD;either quickly evade projectiles, like rockets, flak shells or plasma/pulse balls. Or you&#xD;can irritate your opponent, so that he is losing his lock when shooting with instant hit&#xD;weapons. It can also turn out to your disadvantage though, once you started dodging there&#xD;is no way you can stop in mid-air, so you are easy to predict. Besides that you can do jumps, that are impossible with the normal jump button, because&#xD;when dodging you jump far, not high.&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back&#xD;| top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;&#xD;       Unreal&#xD;Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other&#xD;tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
