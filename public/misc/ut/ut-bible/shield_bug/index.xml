    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News&#xD;Shield Bug&#xD;There is a gameplay bug in UT, that has quite an impact on the game, especially in duels.&#xA;Because Epic didn`t fix this bug yet, although they know of it since version 405, I&#xD;started to look at it as a feature, not a bug. Of course murphy`s law dictates, that Epic&#xD;will fix it now.&#xA;Anyway, using this feature you can have up to 50 points more armor, than the maximum of&#xD;150, which means 33% more armor!&#xA;The bug is simple. You`ve got a shield and get wounded, for example down to 80 shield. Now&#xD;if you take the armor you get 150 - 80 = 70 armor, so you have 150 again, 80 shield and 70&#xD;armor. If you also take the thigh pads with this armor status you shouldn`t get any&#xD;additional armor. But that`s where the shield-bug comes into play. If you have shield and&#xD;armor, only the shield will be counted when picking up pads. So you get an additional 50&#xD;armor. All in all you have 80 shield, 70 armor and 50 pads now, which makes a total of 200&#xD;armor. The hud will still show 150, but if you get wounded you can see that the 1st 50&#xD;damage won`t be substracted. This also works, if you take pads before armor.&#xA;Your shield should be down to 50-100 points, when picking up armor/pads, for optimal&#xD;results. Here is a graph, that shows why:&#xA;                                     &#34;the&#xD;extra armor is depending on the shield status&#34;&#xA;If you couldn`t follow me with that explanation, here is in short what you have to do:&#xA;1. get shield&#xA;2. get wounded or wound yourself down to 50-100 shield&#xA;3. get armor&#xA;4. get pads&#xA;The chronological order of 3 and 4 can be changed.&#xA;It`s not easy to take advantage of this bug, but those 50 points more armor can be the&#xD;difference between life and death, sometimes at least (-;&#xA;Of course this only works in maps with shield, armor and pads, so it comes down to Turbine&#xD;and Deck16 in duels.&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back&#xD;| top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;&#xD;       Unreal&#xD;Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other&#xD;tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
