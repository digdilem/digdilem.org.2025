    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News&#xD;Controls&#xD;Let�s start with the basics. The most basic thing I can think about is the controller&#xD;setup. I strongly suggest to use either a mouse/keyboard or a trackball/keyboard&#xD;combination. Some people are also successful with more exotic setups like a joystick&#xD;instead of the keyboard or even with controllertypes like the claw or the gauntlet, but&#xD;the majority uses mouse/keyboard.&#xA;How to setup the keys is mostly personal preference. You won�t play as good as a&#xD;topplayer just by using his configuration. The only things that matter is that you can&#xD;easily reach every key you need and that you have easy and fast access to every important&#xD;weapon.&#xA;Your mouse sensitivity shouldn�t be less than 8cm/360� turn, but not more than&#xD;12cm/360� turn. As a rule of thumb, the lower your sensitivity, the better your aiming&#xD;with instant hit weapons and the higher your sensitivity the better your aiming with&#xD;delayed and reflex weapons like rl, flak, bio, ripper and asmd secondary. My sensitivity&#xD;is around 12cm/360� turn, which is imho the slowest setting that`s still playable.&#xA;If you�ve got a PS/2-mouse, I urge you to use PS/2rate for Windows, your&#xD;movement will get much more precise. And if you�ve got a serial mouse, you should&#xD;consider buying a PS/2 mouse or better USB, because the serial mouse frequency of 40Hz&#xD;just sucks compared to USB (125Hz) and PS/2 (200Hz). USB is the best choice, cause you&#xD;always have 125Hz compared to PS/2, where the frequency drops with shorter movements.&#xA;Only one advice concerning the mouse, don`t use optical mice for first person shooters,&#xD;especially if you have a low sensitivity.&#xA;In the weapons menu you should disable the automatic weapon switch, so that you have full&#xD;control over weapon switches and don�t accidently switch to a weapon you don�t want. Here you can get my user.ini as an example or take a look&#xD;at my keys here:&#xA;                                                         &#xD;&#34;lots of keys in reach&#34;&#xA;                                &#xD;   &#34;good old logitech 3 button mouse on the&#xD;godlike func-pad&#34;&#xA;movement: Left Mouse:&#xD;  move forward&#xD;Right Mouse:    move back&#xD;Z:&#xD;  strafe left&#xD;I:&#xD;  strafe right&#xD;U:&#xD;  jump&#xD;J:&#xD;  duck&#xD;K:&#xD;  walking&#xD;     attack:  Space:    primary fire&#xD;Alt:&#xD;  secondary fire&#xD;Comma:    instant rocket fire and/or switch to Rocket Launcher&#xD;weapons:&#xD;5:&#xD;  Impact Hammer&#xD;6:&#xD;  Enforcer&#xD;7:&#xD;  Pulse Gun&#xD;8:&#xD;  Minigun&#xD;9:   Shock Rifle&#xD;0:&#xD;  Sniper Rifle&#xD;O:&#xD;  Bio Rifle&#xD;P:&#xD;  Ripper&#xD;    other:&#xD;Middle Mouse:    scoreboard&#xD;F:&#xD;  throw weapon&#xD;D:&#xD;  Feign Death&#xD;Just some comments about my personal setup. I am using a&#xD;&#34;zuij&#34;-setup, because these keys are in the middle of the keyboard, so I can&#xD;reach a lot more keys (23) than with any other setup. This isn�t that important in duels,&#xD;but it is very useful in teamplay for teammessages.&#xA;I am shooting with space/alt and moving forward/backwards with the mouse. I don`t shoot&#xD;with the mouse like the majority of the FPS players, because when pressing a mousebutton&#xD;you move your mouse a bit, no matter if you want or not and therefore your aiming gets&#xD;inaccurate when shooting with the mouse. The only negative point about this is that I&#xD;can�t do the rocket pack special with the rocket launcher, because I only have one finger&#xD;(the thumb) for primary and secondary attack mode and you have to press both at once to&#xD;shoot the rockets tightly packed. I suggest to use as few aliases as possible, because UT lags most of the time, when&#xD;executing more than 1 command/alias at a time, which already cost me lots of nerves.&#xD;That`s why I only use 1 small alias with more than 1 command, a quick switch to instant&#xD;rockets, combined with an attack command when pressing the button and a switch back to&#xD;multirockets, when releasing it:&#xA;&#34;setinstantrocket 1 | fire | Button bFire | onrelease setinstantrocket 0&#34;&#xA;Another alias I use makes the scoreboard pop up when pressing the score button and hide&#xD;again when releasing it. I`m used to that from QW and opposed to the Q2-style scoreboard&#xD;in UT it`s imho faster. You just shouldn`t press the score button while you are dead, or&#xD;the scoreboard won`t hide anymore:&#xA;ShowScores | onrelease showscores&#xA;Something else I changed is, that I lowered the dodgeclicktime in the user.ini a bit to&#xD;0.185, so that I don�t dodge accidently anymore.&#xA;Here are some other aliases you may find useful:&#xA;weapon grouping:&#xA;With this alias you can select the best weapon you have of a list of weapons. The alias&#xD;&#34;switchweapon 8 | switchweapon 4 | switchweapon 9&#34; would for example select the&#xD;Rocket Launcher (weapon 9) and if you don`t have the RL or if you are out of rockets it&#xD;would select the ASMD (weapon 4), if you don`t have that it would select the flak (weapon&#xD;8). Most useful is this alias with weapons that are very similar, like pulse gun and&#xD;minigun: &#34;switchweapon 5 | switchweapon 7&#34; or like enforcer and sniper rifle:&#xD;&#34;switchweapon 2 | switchweapon 10&#34;.&#xA;If you only use 2 weapons in the alias you can even switch between the 2 by pressing the&#xD;button several times. This helps to save some important buttons.&#xA;feign&amp;drop:&#xA;This alias makes feigndeath look a bit more real. You drop your weapon when feigning&#xD;death, just like you would drop your weapon when dying. I still don`t recommend to use&#xD;this more than once every 1000 years (-;&#xA;&#34;throwweapon | feigndeath&#34;&#xA;walk&amp;jump:&#xA;With this alias you can jump normally although you have jumpboots, so you can save them&#xD;for jumps where you really need them. It`s like walking and jumping, only that you don`t&#xD;have to walk manually. You should be aware though, that you jump not as high as normally&#xD;using this alias.&#xA;&#34;button brun | jump&#34;&#xA;Because my setup is very unusual, you can download the user.ini of some of my Ocrana&#xD;clanmates here.&#xA;Cptmeat&#xA;Fragmaster&#xA;Loser&#xA;Mr.Frost&#xA;Suicidesmurf&#xA;Titan&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back&#xD;| top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;&#xD;       Unreal&#xD;Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other&#xD;tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
