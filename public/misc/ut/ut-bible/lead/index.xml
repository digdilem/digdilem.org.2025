    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News&#xD;Lead&#xD;The frag lead although not directly connected to gameplay has a massive influence on the&#xD;playstyle, as odd as it may sound. I just said, that map control is most important, it&#xD;sure is of great importance, but only as long as the scores are tied. If you got the lead&#xD;you don`t need map control. Of course it`s good if you have control to increase your lead,&#xD;but you don`t have to worry a lot if you lose it. There are 2 alternatives when leading,&#xD;it all depends on the time remaining. If there isn`t much time left you can try to hide&#xD;and run from your opponent. Duck in dark corners, feign death behind a crate, wait in&#xD;front of a teleporter ready to flee, impact jump to the most obscure places, just avoid&#xD;fighting at any cost. Let the time work for you, it`s on your side. It`s campy, it`s lame,&#xD;it`s risky, but it`s effective. You shouldn`t do this in fun matches though, cause it&#xD;isn`t fun.&#xA;The 2nd alternative is quite similar at first glance, but works over a much longer time,&#xD;cause yu don`t avoid fighting. If you got the lead, you don`t need to do frags, all you&#xD;need to do is to make sure, is that your opponent doesn`t get frags. This is best done by&#xD;taking away his big advantage, his armor/shield. The best method to do this is to wait at&#xD;a safe place, where you got the shield/armor in sight, and shoot him, as soon as he takes&#xD;it. Your best bet would be to snipe him out of the distance, it only takes 1 headshot, to&#xD;get rid off his shield. In deck16 this also works with the boots.&#xA;It isn`t so much about ressources anymore, once the 1st frag is made, it`s also about&#xD;fragging and the guy with the lead decides where the fragging takes place...&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back&#xD;| top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;&#xD;       Unreal&#xD;Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other&#xD;tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
