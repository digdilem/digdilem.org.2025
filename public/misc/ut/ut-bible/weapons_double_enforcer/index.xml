    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News Weapons - Double Enforcer Damagehit:   25h   Rate: 5.6/s primary 7.6/s secondary Inaccuracy: 2.1 degrees primary 2.1 degrees, increasing up to 8.5 degrees secondary Damage/s: 140h primary 190h secondary If you pick up a second enforcer you can use one in every hand, John Woo style. The firing rates are almost like that of the minigun in primary mode, but the double enforcer is much less accurate than the mg or the single enforcer, so you should prefere the mg, if you got it.&#xA;A great advantage about the double enorcer is that the player model looks like that of someone wielding a single enforcer, so you can trick your opponent into attacking, but I wouldn�t do something that risky in a duel.&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back | top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;        Unreal Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
