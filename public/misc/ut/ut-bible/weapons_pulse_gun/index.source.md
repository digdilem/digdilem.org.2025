    Most people underestimate the Pulse Gun, just because the Minigun is the better rapid fire
    instant hit gun. Indeed, the secondary fire, which shoots something like the Lightning Gun
    in Quake can´t match the damage per second of the Minigun. Another disadvantage is that
    it only has a ranged effect, just like the Lightning Gun in Quake. But the secondary
    fire`s big advantage compared to the minigun is, that it`s 100% accurate, which often
    makes it an equally good choice as the minigun at mid-range. It even consumes far less
    ammo than the Minigun.<br>
    The primary fire can also be pretty dangerous in close range fights, when spamming long
    range or when retreating around corners.<br>
    To sum it up: the main reason why the pulse can be very effective is because most people
    think, that it isn`t effective. Strange but true (-;<br>
    <br>
    There is a little trick to get more damage out of the pulse. The green lightsaber-like
    effect is divided in its length into 10 segments of 81uu length. Each of these segments
    does a fixed damage of 10.8 health on first contact with the player. So if you move
    towards an opponent and back away from him you are doing a bit more damage, than usually.
    The best thing about this is, that the segments &quot;forget&quot; their last target as
    soon as you switch to a different segment, so the 10.8 damage on 1st contact always
    refreshes. That`s why the best method would be to switch fast between 2 segments, but you
    would have to know the exact segment borders in order to do that and they are too
    difficult to see. But theoretically you could do an insane amount of damage with this
    method.<br>
    This is the reason, why the pulse seems to do much more damage sometimes.<br>

    <br>
    A cool way to remember this trick is to imagine, that you got a saw in your hands, which
    you have to move forward and back all the time (-;<br>
