    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News&#xD;Weapons - Pulse Gun&#xD;Damage/hit:   30h   Rate:&#xD;6.1/s&#xD;primary&#xD;Length:&#xD;729&#xD;Damage/s:&#xD;185h&#xD;primary&#xD;114h&#xD;secondary&#xD;Most people underestimate the Pulse Gun, just because the Minigun is the better rapid fire&#xD;instant hit gun. Indeed, the secondary fire, which shoots something like the Lightning Gun&#xD;in Quake can�t match the damage per second of the Minigun. Another disadvantage is that&#xD;it only has a ranged effect, just like the Lightning Gun in Quake. But the secondary&#xD;fire`s big advantage compared to the minigun is, that it`s 100% accurate, which often&#xD;makes it an equally good choice as the minigun at mid-range. It even consumes far less&#xD;ammo than the Minigun.&#xA;The primary fire can also be pretty dangerous in close range fights, when spamming long&#xD;range or when retreating around corners.&#xA;To sum it up: the main reason why the pulse can be very effective is because most people&#xD;think, that it isn`t effective. Strange but true (-;&#xA;There is a little trick to get more damage out of the pulse. The green lightsaber-like&#xD;effect is divided in its length into 10 segments of 81uu length. Each of these segments&#xD;does a fixed damage of 10.8 health on first contact with the player. So if you move&#xD;towards an opponent and back away from him you are doing a bit more damage, than usually.&#xD;The best thing about this is, that the segments &#34;forget&#34; their last target as&#xD;soon as you switch to a different segment, so the 10.8 damage on 1st contact always&#xD;refreshes. That`s why the best method would be to switch fast between 2 segments, but you&#xD;would have to know the exact segment borders in order to do that and they are too&#xD;difficult to see. But theoretically you could do an insane amount of damage with this&#xD;method.&#xA;This is the reason, why the pulse seems to do much more damage sometimes.&#xA;                                             &#xD;&#34;the 10 segments of the pulse beam&#34;&#xA;A cool way to remember this trick is to imagine, that you got a saw in your hands, which&#xD;you have to move forward and back all the time (-;&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back&#xD;| top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;&#xD;       Unreal&#xD;Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other&#xD;tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
