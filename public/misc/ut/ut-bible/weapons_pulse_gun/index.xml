    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News Weapons - Pulse Gun Damage/hit:   30h   Rate: 6.1/s primary Length: 729 Damage/s: 185h primary 114h secondary Most people underestimate the Pulse Gun, just because the Minigun is the better rapid fire instant hit gun. Indeed, the secondary fire, which shoots something like the Lightning Gun in Quake can�t match the damage per second of the Minigun. Another disadvantage is that it only has a ranged effect, just like the Lightning Gun in Quake. But the secondary fire`s big advantage compared to the minigun is, that it`s 100% accurate, which often makes it an equally good choice as the minigun at mid-range. It even consumes far less ammo than the Minigun.&#xA;The primary fire can also be pretty dangerous in close range fights, when spamming long range or when retreating around corners.&#xA;To sum it up: the main reason why the pulse can be very effective is because most people think, that it isn`t effective. Strange but true (-;&#xA;There is a little trick to get more damage out of the pulse. The green lightsaber-like effect is divided in its length into 10 segments of 81uu length. Each of these segments does a fixed damage of 10.8 health on first contact with the player. So if you move towards an opponent and back away from him you are doing a bit more damage, than usually. The best thing about this is, that the segments &#34;forget&#34; their last target as soon as you switch to a different segment, so the 10.8 damage on 1st contact always refreshes. That`s why the best method would be to switch fast between 2 segments, but you would have to know the exact segment borders in order to do that and they are too difficult to see. But theoretically you could do an insane amount of damage with this method.&#xA;This is the reason, why the pulse seems to do much more damage sometimes.&#xA;                                              &#34;the 10 segments of the pulse beam&#34;&#xA;A cool way to remember this trick is to imagine, that you got a saw in your hands, which you have to move forward and back all the time (-;&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back | top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;        Unreal Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
