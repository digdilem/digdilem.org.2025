    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News Respawning Respawning in UT is random, but depends a lot on the position of your opponent.&#xA;You probably know from teamsay, that each UT map is divided into different zones. For example in Tempest there is Westwing, DamageAmp, Rocketroom and Shieldbelt. The locations in teamsay aren`t the only occasion where these zones are used though, they also appear in UT`s respawn code. It`s very very likely, that your opponent spawns in a zone you are not in. In fact, if the distance between you and a player start in a different zone is higher than 750 unreal units he cannot spawn in your zone at all (As a reference, a player model is 78 unreal units tall, has a width of 38 unreal units and moves 400 unreal units per second). There are some exceptions to this rule though:&#xA;1. You don`t spawn at the same player spawn point twice in a row.&#xA;2. If the player start is in line of sight to your opponent, you won`t spawn there.&#xA;3. Spawntelefragging is impossible in UT, but that`s covered by line of sight anyway.&#xA;So these are some basic rules if you want your opponent to spawn at a certain player start:&#xA;1. Stay in a different zone.&#xA;2. Stay out of sight.&#xA;3. Stay as far away as possible, at least 750 unreal units&#xA;If you are curious about the zones, you can look them up using UnrealEd. All you have to do is to load the map you want to see, for example DM-Tempest.unr and then you have to click on the last symbol in one of the windows, which is called &#34;Zone/Portal&#34;.                                   &#34;tempest from above the shieldroom in zoneview&#34;&#xA;To put it in a nutshell, if you know the zones you can often predict where the guy you just killed respawns.&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back | top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;        Unreal Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
