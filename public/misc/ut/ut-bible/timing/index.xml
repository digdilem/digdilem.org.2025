    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News&#xD;Timing&#xD;Since &#34;Duke Nukem 3D&#34; the items in first person shooters don�t vanish forever&#xD;when they are picked up, but they come back after a specific time, which is also called&#xD;respawning. To deny your opponent access to the items the best thing to do is to be at the&#xD;place where the item respawns the second it respawns. Because it is always the same time&#xD;between pickup and respawn you don�t have to rely on luck to achieve that, but you can&#xD;time the respawns.                                                  &#34;The&#xD;armor in Codex respawning&#34;&#xA;Here are some respawn times of items you should know:&#xA;Item: Seconds: Shield   55&#xD;Armor     27,5&#xD;Boots     27,5&#xD;Pad     27,5&#xD;Ammo   27,5&#xD;Vitals   27,5&#xD;Health   18,33&#xD;There are several methods for timing items.&#xA;The most obvious but also least accurate one is timing by your feeling. Although this sort&#xD;of timing gets better the longer you play you will never be accurate on the second.&#xA;A much better method is to use a clock attached to the monitor, a program that times for&#xD;you, such as a midi timer controlled by the windows hotkeys or someone standing behind you&#xD;to time the items for you. All of this is certainly a great advantage but it often isn�t&#xD;allowed in tournaments, so you shouldn�t get used to those methods.&#xA;The only solution left is to use the gametime, which is shown at the bottom in the&#xD;scoreboard. There you can always see the remaining time in the game. So you just have to&#xD;look at the time when picking up an item and you can calculate when it will respawn.&#xA;If you pick up the shield at 8:30 for example, then it will respawn at 7:35. To make it&#xD;easier you can leave away the minutes and just memorize the seconds, because only the&#xD;powerups Damage Amplifier and Invisibility have respawn times longer than a minute and&#xD;duels are played without powerups.&#xA;Only looking at the seconds also makes the calculation a bit easier. Instead of&#xD;substracting 55 seconds you can just add 5 seconds and you�ve got the respawn time.                                                                   &#34;next&#xD;shield at 54&#34;&#xA;The shield is the only item I am timing on the second in duels, because I just can�t&#xD;memorize different times at once and most of the time I don�t even have to. The only&#xD;things worth timing besides the shield are armor and boots. Because you will guard the&#xD;armor most of the match you won�t need to time it. And because boots have the same&#xD;respawn time as armor you only have to pick up armor, then immediately pick up boots and&#xD;the next time the armor respawns you know that the boots will also respawn soon.&#xA;You should be aware that when playing without timelimit the remaining time is replaced by&#xD;elapsed time, so you have to substract 5 seconds instead of adding them.&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back&#xD;| top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;&#xD;       Unreal&#xD;Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other&#xD;tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
