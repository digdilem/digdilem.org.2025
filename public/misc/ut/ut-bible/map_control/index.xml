    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News&#xD;Map Control&#xD;Duel might look similar to normal deathmatch for the unexperienced player, but it is a&#xD;very different playstyle. The main skills are strategic play, prediction and timing&#xD;opposed to Free For All, where the main skills are aiming and guarding important areas,&#xD;aka camping.&#xA;Control&#xA;Although the maps played in duel are very different there is a general scheme in every&#xD;map, because except Grinder every popular duel-map has every weapon, 1 pair of pads, 1&#xD;armor and 1 shield. It is always about denying your opponent access to the defensive&#xD;items, mainly armor and shield. There are 2 reasons why you should want to do that. You&#xD;keep your opponents health down and yours up.&#xA;That�s why in duel it�s not so much about getting frags, it�s about armor and shield&#xD;control. Once you�ve got that the frags will come alone. The best way to control both at once is to stay at the armor until about 15-10 seconds&#xD;before the shield respawns. Then you have to get shield and get back to the armor before&#xD;the next armor respawns. In order to do that you need a very good shield timing, this is&#xD;probably one of the most important skills in duels. I will explain some timing tricks&#xD;later.&#xA;This strategy requires the armor to be out of sync with the shield. You don�t want the&#xD;armor to respawn just as the shield respawns, so you shouldn�t always take the armor&#xD;immediately. If you wait until 15 seconds before the shield respawns you have 15 seconds&#xD;to get the shield and 15 seconds to get back to the armor, which is more than enough time&#xD;in most maps.&#xA;Of course it isn�t easy to control both armor and shield, because your opponent will try&#xD;to get at least one of them. Furthermore in most maps there are only 2-3 ways from armor&#xD;to shield, so it�s easy to get ambushed and with UT�s strong weapons your armor&#xD;advantage is usually gone with 1 hit, so you have to be very careful when going from armor&#xD;to shield. Even if you made it to the shield you still won�t be safe, because unlike armor the&#xD;shield is very accessible in most duel maps, so you can�t really defend it for long.&#xD;That�s why your shield timing has to be as exact as possible. If your opponent is low on health after the shield attack you can try to get a frag, but&#xD;you shouldn�t forget about armor. The best time to try making a frag is between the 2&#xD;armor respawns, because you have 27,5 seconds time before you have to return.&#xA;Here is a short illustration that should help you to understand what I am talking about:&#xA;Time in seconds:   Item:   Phase:                            &#xD;0&#xD;I&#xD;13.75&#xD;I&#xD;27.5&#xD;II&#xD;41.25&#xD;III&#xD;55&#xD;III/I&#xD;68.75&#xD;I&#xD;82.5&#xD;II&#xD;                 &#xD;etc...&#xD;In Phase I you have to get from shield to armor. You should go there as fast as possible,&#xD;only trying to get a frag if you get a good chance.&#xA;In Phase II, after picking up the armor you have 27,5 seconds time to do whatever you&#xD;want. You can hunt your opponent, get weapons you don�t have yet, get boots, pads, ammo&#xD;or vials. You just have to be back at the armor before it respawns.&#xA;In Phase III you have to get from armor to shield in time before the shield respawns, this&#xD;is just like Phase I only the direction changed.&#xA;After that everything repeats, starting with Phase I again, where you have to get from&#xD;shield to armor.&#xA;If you manage to do this you leave your opponent with only the pads (if there are pads on&#xD;the map) and vials, which gives you at least 100 armor advantage. This won`t help you&#xD;anything if your opponent surprises you, but you should have enough advantage to win a&#xD;normal gunfight.&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back&#xD;| top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;&#xD;       Unreal&#xD;Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other&#xD;tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
