    <meta name="description" content="UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - NewsMap ControlDuel might look similar to normal deathmatch for the unexperienced player, but it is avery different playstyle. The main skills are strategic play, prediction and timingopposed to Free For All, where the main skills are aiming and guarding important areas,aka camping.
Control
Although the maps played in duel are very different there is a general scheme in everymap, because except Grinder every popular duel-map has every weapon, 1 pair of pads, 1armor and 1 shield. It is always about denying your opponent access to the defensiveitems, mainly armor and shield. There are 2 reasons why you should want to do that. Youkeep your opponents health down and yours up.
That�s why in duel it�s not so much about getting frags, it�s about armor and shieldcontrol. Once you�ve got that the frags will come alone. The best way to control both at once is to stay at the armor until about 15-10 secondsbefore the shield respawns. Then you have to get shield and get back to the armor beforethe next armor respawns. In order to do that you need a very good shield timing, this isprobably one of the most important skills in duels. I will explain some timing trickslater.
This strategy requires the armor to be out of sync with the shield. You don�t want thearmor to respawn just as the shield respawns, so you shouldn�t always take the armorimmediately. If you wait until 15 seconds before the shield respawns you have 15 secondsto get the shield and 15 seconds to get back to the armor, which is more than enough timein most maps.
Of course it isn�t easy to control both armor and shield, because your opponent will tryto get at least one of them. Furthermore in most maps there are only 2-3 ways from armorto shield, so it�s easy to get ambushed and with UT�s strong weapons your armoradvantage is usually gone with 1 hit, so you have to be very careful when going from armorto shield. Even if you made it to the shield you still won�t be safe, because unlike armor theshield is very accessible in most duel maps, so you can�t really defend it for long.That�s why your shield timing has to be as exact as possible. If your opponent is low on health after the shield attack you can try to get a frag, butyou shouldn�t forget about armor. The best time to try making a frag is between the 2armor respawns, because you have 27,5 seconds time before you have to return.
Here is a short illustration that should help you to understand what I am talking about:
Time in seconds:   Item:   Phase:                            0I13.75I27.5II41.25III55III/I68.75I82.5II                 etc...In Phase I you have to get from shield to armor. You should go there as fast as possible,only trying to get a frag if you get a good chance.
In Phase II, after picking up the armor you have 27,5 seconds time to do whatever youwant. You can hunt your opponent, get weapons you don�t have yet, get boots, pads, ammoor vials. You just have to be back at the armor before it respawns.
In Phase III you have to get from armor to shield in time before the shield respawns, thisis just like Phase I only the direction changed.
After that everything repeats, starting with Phase I again, where you have to get fromshield to armor.
If you manage to do this you leave your opponent with only the pads (if there are pads onthe map) and vials, which gives you at least 100 armor advantage. This won`t help youanything if your opponent surprises you, but you should have enough advantage to win anormal gunfight.
