    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News&#xD;Weapons - Sniper Rifle&#xD;Damage:   67.5   normal&#xD;150&#xD;headshot&#xD;Rate:&#xD;1.7/s   Damage/s:   115h&#xD;primary&#xD;255h&#xD;headshot&#xD;The Sniper Rifle is UT�s Railgun, there simply is no better weapon for&#xD;long distant fights. But unlike the Railgun in Quake 2/3 it doesn�t have the disadvantage&#xD;of a long reload time. That�s why it�s even a strong weapon for mid range, and if you&#xD;are good with it, even for low range fights.&#xA;Especially open areas are easy to dominate with the sniper rifle, there isn�t much you&#xD;can do against a good sniper in Deck16 for example.&#xA;There are basically 2 styles to aim with the sniper rifle. The 1st style is&#xD;self-explaining, it is reflex aiming. You just move your mouse at your opponents position&#xD;and shoot as soon as you &#34;hit&#34; him with the crosshair. This requires lots of&#xD;practice, but always works.&#xA;The 2nd style is easier to perform, but has it�s disadvantages. I would call it fixed&#xD;aiming. You have to think of your gun as some sort of self firing system. As soon as&#xD;someone enters your crosshair you shoot without moving your mouse hand. You should aim at&#xD;bottlenecks, positions where he has to go through or at items he will be going for. You&#xD;can also use this method during a fight. If he strafes left you keep your cross to his&#xD;right, because he will strafe back to the right sooner or later. As soon as he does that&#xD;and enters your crosshair, you shoot his head off.&#xA;One more thing you should learn when using the rifle is to shoot only when you are sure to&#xD;hit. There are many players who just keep their finger on the attack button instead of&#xD;waiting for the right moment. The high shot frequency of course invites to do so, but you&#xD;usually have much more hits and of course a lower ammo consumption if you are waiting for&#xD;the right time to shoot.&#xA;Like with the Ripper you get a headshot if you hit your opponent`s player model in the&#xD;upper third. With a good aiming this makes the Rifle one of the most important weapons in&#xD;the game.&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back&#xD;| top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;&#xD;       Unreal&#xD;Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other&#xD;tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
