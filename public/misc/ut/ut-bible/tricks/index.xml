    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News&#xD;Tricks&#xD;In UT there are 3 main physic tricks you can take advantage of.&#xA;One of these is the elevator jump. If you jump on an elevator, the elevator speed is added&#xD;to the jump speed, so you jump much higher than usually. This is especially popular in&#xD;Deck16, where you can jump up at the armor, even though the elevator is only half-way up.&#xD;This is also how you can jump from the elevator to the sniper rifle in Codex, or from the&#xD;main elevator in Curse to the middle bridge.&#xA;The next trick is only possible with dodging and only if there are non-vertical walls. If&#xD;you dodge against such a wall your sidespeed is converted to upspeed, so you can reach&#xD;higher places, than when jumping normally. Especially useful is this trick in Curse, where&#xD;there are lots of non-vertical walls. You can jump up to the healthpacks/secret ammo room&#xD;near the flak from amp for example. But this is also useful in Liandri for example, where&#xD;you can dodge up to the Bio Rifle when coming from the flak.&#xA;The last physic trick is the Impact Hammer jump, I already mentioned. Just look down to&#xD;the floor, while loading your Impact Hammer in primary fire, then jump and release the&#xD;fire at the same time. You will jump much higher than usually at the cost of 54 health.&#xD;You can also jump with the secondary fire. You will only lose 13h, but you won`t jump as&#xD;high. This is perfect for the jump to the amp in Turbine. This works with every weapon, that has splash damage. But the Impact hammer has the best&#xD;damage/height efficiency. The only occasion where I would use a different weapon is, if&#xD;you spawn at the ASMD in Turbine and try to get shield as fast as possible. The fastest&#xD;method is to open the shieldroom with an ASMD primary and immediately jump up with an ASMD&#xD;secondary jump. Here is a demo of all the 3 physic tricks done in Curse.&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back&#xD;| top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;&#xD;       Unreal&#xD;Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other&#xD;tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
