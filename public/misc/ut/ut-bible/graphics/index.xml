    <description>UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News&#xD;Graphics&#xD;When it comes to shooters the most important things about the graphics are high fps and a&#xD;high viewability. Basically if your fps drops below 50 during a match then you�ve got a&#xD;problem.&#xA;I don�t recommend software mode, unlike Quake engine games the viewability in this mode&#xD;is very bad in UT, so you should use the Glide, Direct3d or Opengl graphic modes. You will&#xD;also get a higher fps in these modes with most video cards.&#xA;To achieve a high fps and good viewability you should turn off any unnecessary graphics&#xD;effect possible. In UT this is best done using the advanced options menu, by typing &#34;preferences&#34;&#xD;in the console.&#xA;In the rendering options I suggest to turn off Coronas, Detailtextures, Shiny Surfaces,&#xD;Volumetric Lighting, but leave highdetailactors on. With hda off all the smoke effects are&#xD;removed, but you have a 1 second delay before you see that someone took shield and you&#xD;will have problems seeing if someone has shield. You have to do this with the rendering&#xD;mode you are using, if you are using direct3d but changing the 3dfx glide settings there&#xD;will be no difference.&#xA;                                                            &#xD;&#34;the rendering options&#34;&#xA;In the display options you should turn off curved surfaces, decals, dynamic lights,&#xD;fractal animation, screenflashes and set the texture detail to low, but use a high skin&#xD;detail. The minimum desired framerate should be set to something unrealistically high, for&#xD;example 500 fps.&#xA;I have my brightness set to maximum, but this depends on the monitor, the video mode,&#xD;drivers and additional programs like Powerstrip.&#xA;                                                            &#xD;&#34;the display options&#34;&#xA;Why to set skin detail to high is easily explained. If all the wall and floor textures are&#xD;blurred (low detail) then player, weapon and item models will stick out more from the&#xD;scenery if they are high detail (like d_mipscale 666 in qw). If you can sacrifice those&#xD;few fps for a better viewability, don�t hesitate.&#xA;In the game options you should set the weapon hand to hidden, gore level to reduced and&#xD;disable the view bob for better viewability. You shouldn�t use gore level ultra low,&#xD;because you won�t see if you hit with the pulse gun if the blood is green.&#xA;In the hud options you should use light blue as hud color, cause it`s the best color to&#xD;see if you have boots. The player status size should be high enough to see the boots, but&#xD;all in all the hud should be as small as possible, especially with voodoo cards, so the&#xD;frag count and chat box should be disabled. Everything else is personal preference.&#xA;You should use a low resolution to get more fps, but I wouldn�t use a resolution lower&#xD;than 640x480, because you won�t see some of the information on the scoreboard like&#xD;ping/packet loss with lower resolutions.&#xA;You shouldn`t alter the field of view (fov). Although you have a better overview using a&#xD;higher fov, your aiming, especially with instant hit weapons will suffer. In duel you&#xD;don�t need a good overview, cause you should know where your opponent is anyway, but you&#xD;sure need a good aiming. If I would have to change it I would lower it, but the default&#xD;setting is fine imho.&#xA;Here is my unrealtournament.ini, if you want to&#xD;take a look at it.&#xA;&lt;&lt;&lt; back&#xD;| top | next &gt;&gt;&gt;&#xD;       Unreal&#xD;Tournament and the stylized &#34;U&#34; are trademarks of Epic Games, Inc.&#xA;All other&#xD;tradmarks are the property of their respective companies.&#xA;� 2000/2001 - Florian Bl�mm</description>
