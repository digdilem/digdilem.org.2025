    <meta name="description" content="UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - NewsInfoHere is some information about what I intended to create here in Q&amp;A-style.
What is this all about?
Well, this is supposed to be something like Thresh�s Quake Bible at Gamers Extreme, for UT and only for duel. Thetarget audience are mediocre players, but maybe even some top players can learn a thing ortwo. If you are still a bloody newbie you should visit the Playstation2 Unreal Tournament Strategy Guide at Gamepro.com first.
Thresh? Gamers Extreme?
Thresh was THE duel god in early Quake1 and Quake2-times and the 1st pro gamer ever. Hegot famous for winning Carmack�s Ferrari at the Red Annihilation tournament 1997.
Gamers Extreme was a very popular page among U.S.-Quakers and later also among otherU.S.-Gamers 2-3 years ago, especially the online forums were very frequented. They alsohave a nice collection of helpful strategy-guides for different games, including some coolAge of Empires-strats, which helped me to become a top10 player in Germany and of courseincluding Thresh�s Quake Bible, a strategy guide for Quake, which helped me to understandwhat duelling is really about. :                                                                                                                &#34;Thresh`s GX QuakeBible&#34;
So you are the new Thresh?
No, certainly not. I am a well known and respected duel player in Europe, but I am a longshot from being UT�s Thresh, mainly considering my skills. I am more a thinker than aplayer, my original genre (before Quake1) were real time strategy games. Thresh insteadwas both a great thinker and a good player. He was always some months ahead in terms ofstrategy and his aiming was superior. He relied a lot on 1st level prediction, the art totry figuring out where your opponent is and what he is going to do without seeing him.This is exactly my main strength in duels.
Another difference is, that Thresh stopped playing when he knew his time was over, I amnot that intelligent (-;
So it`s about UT duel, and which settings exactly?
I can only write about the settings I know and that is lan environment
gamespeed 100%
gamemode hardcore
timelimit 15-20
fraglimit 0
weaponstay on
no powerups, except boots
no redeemer
everything else enabled
Note, when saying no powerups, I am not referring to the nopowerups mutator from Epic.
Using the usual First Person Shooters definition, powerups in UT are Damage Amplifier,Invisibility and Anti-Grav Boots. Shield is an armor, Vials and Keg are health, so thenopowerups mutator disables a bit too many items to be useful. There are 2 mutatorsavailable, that disable Amp and Invis only, those are the ones used on most servers, youcan get them herefor example.                                                                           &#34;all the mutators you need&#34;
Why should you want to give away the &#34;secret of your success&#34;?
Frankly said, I am not the top player I was half a year ago. My opponents didn`t sleep,while I was inactive, so I don`t have much to lose right now. Besides that, I like doingconstructive things. The last time I did something like that for the public is already 3years in the past now and I am not too proud of my first child... Besides that, imitation is one of the most-used methods to show admiration.
Is it fun asking yourself questions?
Yes, definately (-:
