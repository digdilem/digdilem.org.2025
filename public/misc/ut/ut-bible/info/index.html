    <meta name="description" content="UT BIBLE by ocr*flocutus - News Info Here is some information about what I intended to create here in Q&amp;A-style.
What is this all about?
Well, this is supposed to be something like Threshï¿½s Quake Bible at Gamers Extreme, for UT and only for duel. The target audience are mediocre players, but maybe even some top players can learn a thing or two. If you are still a bloody newbie you should visit the Playstation2 Unreal Tournament Strategy Guide at Gamepro.com first.
Thresh? Gamers Extreme?
Thresh was THE duel god in early Quake1 and Quake2-times and the 1st pro gamer ever. He got famous for winning Carmackï¿½s Ferrari at the Red Annihilation tournament 1997.
Gamers Extreme was a very popular page among U.S.-Quakers and later also among other U.S.-Gamers 2-3 years ago, especially the online forums were very frequented. They also have a nice collection of helpful strategy-guides for different games, including some cool Age of Empires-strats, which helped me to become a top10 player in Germany and of course including Threshï¿½s Quake Bible, a strategy guide for Quake, which helped me to understand what duelling is really about. : Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  &#34;Thresh`s GX Quake Bible&#34;
So you are the new Thresh?
No, certainly not. I am a well known and respected duel player in Europe, but I am a long shot from being UTï¿½s Thresh, mainly considering my skills. I am more a thinker than a player, my original genre (before Quake1) were real time strategy games. Thresh instead was both a great thinker and a good player. He was always some months ahead in terms of strategy and his aiming was superior. He relied a lot on 1st level prediction, the art to try figuring out where your opponent is and what he is going to do without seeing him. This is exactly my main strength in duels.
Another difference is, that Thresh stopped playing when he knew his time was over, I am not that intelligent (-;
So it`s about UT duel, and which settings exactly?
I can only write about the settings I know and that is lan environment
gamespeed 100%
gamemode hardcore
timelimit 15-20
fraglimit 0
weaponstay on
no powerups, except boots
no redeemer
everything else enabled
Note, when saying no powerups, I am not referring to the nopowerups mutator from Epic.
Using the usual First Person Shooters definition, powerups in UT are Damage Amplifier, Invisibility and Anti-Grav Boots. Shield is an armor, Vials and Keg are health, so the nopowerups mutator disables a bit too many items to be useful. There are 2 mutators available, that disable Amp and Invis only, those are the ones used on most servers, you can get them here for example. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  &#34;all the mutators you need&#34;
Why should you want to give away the &#34;secret of your success&#34;?
Frankly said, I am not the top player I was half a year ago. My opponents didn`t sleep, while I was inactive, so I don`t have much to lose right now. Besides that, I like doing constructive things. The last time I did something like that for the public is already 3 years in the past now and I am not too proud of my first child... Besides that, imitation is one of the most-used methods to show admiration.
Is it fun asking yourself questions?
Yes, definately (-:

    Here is some information about what I intended to create here in Q&amp;A-style.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What is this all about?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Well, this is supposed to be something like <a href="http://www.gamersx.com/bibles/quake/"
    target="_blank">Thresh´s Quake Bible</a> at Gamers Extreme, for UT and only for duel. The
    target audience are mediocre players, but maybe even some top players can learn a thing or
    two. If you are still a bloody newbie you should visit the <a
    href="http://www.gamepro.com/index.html?/sony/ps2/games/strategies/7221.shtml"
    target="_blank">Playstation2 Unreal Tournament Strategy Guide</a> at <a
    href="http://www.gamepro.com" target="_blank">Gamepro.com</a> first.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Thresh? Gamers Extreme?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Thresh was THE duel god in early Quake1 and Quake2-times and the 1st pro gamer ever. He
    got famous for winning Carmack´s Ferrari at the Red Annihilation tournament 1997.<br>
    Gamers Extreme was a very popular page among U.S.-Quakers and later also among other
    U.S.-Gamers 2-3 years ago, especially the online forums were very frequented. They also
    have a nice collection of helpful strategy-guides for different games, including some cool
    Age of Empires-strats, which helped me to become a top10 player in Germany and of course
    including Thresh´s Quake Bible, a strategy guide for Quake, which helped me to understand
    what duelling is really about. <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#C0C0C0">&quot;Thresh`s GX Quake
    Bible&quot;</font></strong><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>So you are the new Thresh?</strong><br>
    <br>
    No, certainly not. I am a well known and respected duel player in Europe, but I am a long
    shot from being UT´s Thresh, mainly considering my skills. I am more a thinker than a
    player, my original genre (before Quake1) were real time strategy games. Thresh instead
    was both a great thinker and a good player. He was always some months ahead in terms of
    strategy and his aiming was superior. He relied a lot on 1st level prediction, the art to
    try figuring out where your opponent is and what he is going to do without seeing him.
    This is exactly my main strength in duels.<br>
    Another difference is, that Thresh stopped playing when he knew his time was over, I am
    not that intelligent (-;<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>So it`s about UT duel, and which settings exactly?</strong><br>
    <br>
    I can only write about the settings I know and that is <br>
    lan environment<br>
    gamespeed 100%<br>
    gamemode hardcore<br>
    timelimit 15-20<br>
    fraglimit 0<br>
    weaponstay on<br>
    no powerups, except boots<br>
    no redeemer<br>
    everything else enabled<br>
    <br>
    Note, when saying no powerups, I am not referring to the nopowerups mutator from Epic.<br>
    Using the usual First Person Shooters definition, powerups in UT are Damage Amplifier,
    Invisibility and Anti-Grav Boots. Shield is an armor, Vials and Keg are health, so the
    nopowerups mutator disables a bit too many items to be useful. There are 2 mutators
    available, that disable Amp and Invis only, those are the ones used on most servers, you
    can get them <a href="http://planetunreal.com/osx/mutators/noudaminvismutes.zip">here</a>
    for example. <br>
    <br>
    <img src="01_mutators.jpg" width="401" height="210" hspace="100"><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <strong><font color="#C0C0C0">&quot;all the mutators you need&quot;</font></strong><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Why should you want to give away the &quot;secret of your success&quot;?<br>
    </strong><br>
    Frankly said, I am not the top player I was half a year ago. My opponents didn`t sleep,
    while I was inactive, so I don`t have much to lose right now. Besides that, I like doing
    constructive things. The last time I did something like that for the public is already 3
    years in the past now and I am not too proud of my first child... <br>
    Besides that, imitation is one of the most-used methods to show admiration.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Is it fun asking yourself questions?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Yes, definately (-:<br>
