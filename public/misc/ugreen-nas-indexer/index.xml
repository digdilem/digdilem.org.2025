    <title>Disabling the Ugreen Nas Indexer :: Digital Dilemma</title>
    <link>https://digdilem.org/misc/ugreen-nas-indexer/index.html</link>
    <description>I have a UGREEN NASync DXP2800 NAS. It’s very good with some lovely design touches like the toolless caddies that are amongst the best I’ve ever used, including many enterprise systems.&#xA;But one thing annoys me, and others too, is that it has an inbuilt indexer and thumbnail generator for photos that runs on the files you upload, regardless of whether you want it to, or are even using the bundled Photo software or indexer. Some of use a NAS just to store files for other programs.</description>
