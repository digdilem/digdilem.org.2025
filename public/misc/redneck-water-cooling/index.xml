    <title>Redneck PC Water Cooling :: Digital Dilemma</title>
    <link>https://digdilem.org/misc/redneck-water-cooling/index.html</link>
    <description>Cooling servers using household plumbing&#xA;“How to water cool computers using household plumbing equipment”&#xA;I like peace and quiet. Most water cooling rigs available for home PCs are anything but – they only use water to move the heat away from the CPU and GPU to a finned radiator, then blast it with fans. I thought that radiant cooling would work and not need any fans, so I built a water cooling system. It worked perfectly for a linux server and my gaming windows PC for three years, until I had to free up space and instead focussed on sound proofing a cupboard and using air cooling. This was back in 2010 but there’s no reason why it wouldn’t work today.</description>
