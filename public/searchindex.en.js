    "content": "Flash’s Aimbot FAQ Please note - I wrote this over two decades ago when I was trying to make UT an equal playing field. I’ve no idea if any of it is relevant to other games! – Flash, 2025\nAnd other Unreal-Tournament related cheaty bits Don’t ask me about UT2K3, MOHAA, MW or any other game - I only play UT! Suffice to say that if you can aim a weapon in a first-person-shooter, then there is a cheat for it. Most FPS cheats have similar properties to the below, so this may still be of some use. In-depth info about ASH, by [PiNK]Bunny (Outdated) Catchers CTF have a list of ASH binds too Update October, 2005: Added pic of brightskin for the curious. Some parts of this faq are seriously outdated. Update April, 2005: I did some more checking to see what was out there now. From what I’m hearing, most of the UT cheat writers have now left UT alone and moved up to UT2k4, but one or two still exist. Private cheats (the hardest to block) are rumoured to still be in existence, but the likes of Pure, UTDCC, qValidate etc apparently now kill all, or almost all, publically available cheats\nHowever, servers without top-rate anticheat are still vulnerable and the bots are much more sophisticated than when this FAQ was first written. For example, feature lists now boast that rockets will automatically aim at enemies feet instead of body/head, automatic disabling for grenade and redeemer, stops tracking enemies at the far end of the map that are out of weapon range of your current weapon etc. I think this makes checking for cheating increasingly difficult by merely watching a demo.\n“Tweaks” such as brightskins are still very much in evidence amongst high ranking players. Clanbase this month alone results in Mastertimer catches (A timer that tells you when shieldbelt etc is available) and things like high-contast skins that make a player glow with their associated skin colour. Radar users are still being caught. While these aren’t as bad as aimbots and triggers, they still give an unfair advantage and clanbase will deal strongly with clans found to be using players with such things.\nUpdate November, 2007: Still plenty of aimbots in the wild and anti-cheat development has slowed down to only one realistic choice - UTDC. More evidence of at least one increasingly sophisticated aimbot which is much harder to identify from spec. It can adjust the rate of accuracy - sometimes identifiably through “hit/miss/hit/miss” with instant hit weapons. Tracking is much smoother and seems to have added randomness. It also switches targets by more factors than merely “closest”. It works also with rockets, flak and other weapons, not just hitscan ones. To identify - well, I’m not going to give all the tells since I know aimbot writers have been using this FAQ to find ways around it, so sorry! Suffice to say that an experienced demo watcher or speccer will know something’s not right.\nUT3 beta demo reportedly had an aimbot released for it within six hours of release. I cannot say whether that is accurate, but aimbots certainly were proved in the wild within a week. The beta demo has NO anticheat, no scripting support and no useful admin tools so it’s pretty much a wipeout as far as keeping cheats out is concerned.\nWhat’s an aimbot? It’s a mod for UT that assists with aiming. To put it bluntly, it aims for you with 100% accuracy. You cannot miss. Every sniper round is a headshot, four shots with the enforcer will take out someone with full health. It allows someone with no skill to dominate the game. When used with server-side mods like Instagib it disrupts the game so much there is no point in having a game. Some bots are incredibly sophisticated and offer a whole range of other additions like radar, enhanced HUD and so on.\nSounds 1334!!!11 Wh373 d0 1 g3t 1?!!11!!!!oneoneon Not telling you. See below. And learn to write properly.\nWhy are aimbots bad? Ever played against Loque on godlike? Try it. Died a lot, didn’t you? Now try it with instagib. Bet you never killed him once did you? That’s because the stock UT bot, Loque, has an aiming efficiency of 100%. Loque is using an aimbot. As soon as you are within line of sight he locks onto you and hits you perfectly every time. Someone using an aimbot is basically using the same code as Loque does.\nGames are about skill, someone using an aimbot is not using any skill. There is no point in playing a game against a perfect bot. Forget any idea that you’re playing against the cheater, you’re not. You’re simply putting your own skill against a script that’s 100% perfect, and what’s the skill in standing in one place holding down the fire button? It’s no fun, and why play games when there’s no fun?\nUT has been devastated by aimbots. Not just because they’re used, but because it’s made people paranoid. Does your opponent seem good? Perhaps too good? Maybe he’s using a bot? Could be. Or it could be he’s just good. See the problem?\nPeople who use aimbots and other cheats have no respect for any other player.\nDo I have an aimbot? If you’re asking, then probably not. You know when you are because you don’t have to aim. You’ll also have had to download and install the aimbot.\nHow common are aimbots? It seems to depend where you play and at what time. For myself I don’t see many bots, but it comes in waves. I play only on a few servers I know well, usually against people I know. Some people say they see bots daily, but mostly it’s not nearly as common as the paranoia - fuelled accusations. Don’t assume someone is using a bot because another player has said they are. It’s not unknown for somebody to be accused by another player because they’re simply better and the other player is having a tantrum and wants them kicked.\nI’ve seen the most bots during the school holidays, weekends and usually during the day and early evening. I can’t remember seeing a single bot being played after midnight, which I think my Profile (below) explains.\nI’m fed up with bots and want an honest game! It’s possible. If you encounter a cheat more than once on a server, avoid that server for a while. Play at different times, late at night usually results in better players and fewer cheats, and the pings are better too. Also consider joining a clan. Clan matches are run by a set of rules and if a cheater is proved then that clan will run a very real risk of not only forfeiting the game but possibly getting a stiff penalty or even resulting in the player or clan being banned completely. Clanbase doesn’t prevent cheating from happening, but at least you get some satisfaction knowing they will act if there is proof.\nSee www.clanbase.com for details on clans and leagues.\nI run a server, how do I stop people cheating? There are mods that help prevent cheating. CSHP is the most famous but is no longer being developed and has been compromised badly by several bots. CSHP is no longer a valid option.\nUTPure is being developed but it has a cost. With Pure you cannot run many extra mods on your server because Pure insists on a “pure client”. At the time of writing, some versions of Pure have been compromised so ensure you’re always running the latest.\nClan Vikings have a list of CSHP and PURE mods, past and present, here.\nRead Bunny’s article about ASH also.\nAnti-Shock-Ho is a nice little mod that has rudimentary anti-cheating that has caught a LOT of high profile clan players recently. Amongst other things it checks UT’s ini for common cheating keybinds, and reacts in a variety of ways, like forcing the cheater to say “I’m a cheater!” and kicking him when he tries to use it.\nHere’s an example found during a clan game I played in tonight (had keybinds for a Timer and Radar)\nAnother shot\nUpdate Oct05: ModMenuChecker, UTDC and others are being used with good success.\nUpdate Nov07: A late version UTDC, combined with Pure/ModMenuChecker.\nAnthchecker has some good points, but used alone isn’t very reliable as it’s outdated.\nThere’s a cheating on my server, what can I do? Firstly make sure he is cheating. See paranoia above. One persons’ word ain’t enough. Logs, demos if available and multiple complaints are all good stuff. ASH warnings and UTPure logs are considered proof. However - it is your server and if you don’t want somebody there for any reason, keep ’em out. Unless you’re sure, best not to accuse them of cheating though. It’ll hurt your own reputation.\nUpgrade your anti-cheat protection (i.e.. Pure). Check logs to find the IP of the cheater and ban it. Unfortunately because many people use DHCP or dynamic addresses they may be back. There is no easy solution to this other than the drastic step of banning an entire subnet and possibly denying non-cheating players access also. A short-term subnet ban may discourage the cheater. There is, in fact, a better solution to this - but I can’t reveal it or it would instantly become worthless.\nOne method I’ve used which I can describe about is to hostmask specific ISP’s or hostmask ranges. This is more effective than simple subnetting which can be hugely unreliable (some people get multiple top level ranges which can’t be blocked without significant collateral damage). Exactly how I do this I can’t be specific (sorry) but it involves a perl script and Net::DNS.\nI don’t know of any network of admins who share cheater IP’s but I think it would be a good thing. If you know of one please tell me so I can update this site.\nThere has been suggested a “Hall of Shame” where cheaters nicks are made public, but I don’t think that’s a good thing. For one, it’s too easy to blacklist someone you don’t like, and for another the cheater just changes their nick or worse, even uses someone else’s nick - it’s not like Half-Life , UT2k4 where each CD has a unique key that ID’s the player. The anti-cheat community maintains their own private lists of known and suspected cheats.\nOne server is running an irc channel (irc.quakenet.org - #antibottersinc) which reports known cheaters as and when they’re caught in-game by ASH. Also view #anti-cheat for reports from several server clusters (Jolt, Truffs, GS etc)\nJolt forums quite often list high profile cheaters found on Jolt servers.\nI got kicked by a server that said it had detected a bot! Have you got one? Then good…\nIf you aren’t then try again. Pure especially occasionally takes exception at something in your setup. If you get repeatedly kicked then it’s time to reinstall UT in a new directory. (Reinstalling over itself won’t work) Also note that with UTPG’s 451 patch there is a known problem with older servers not running the latest Pure which can result in result in persistent false positives. Either downgrade or keep two installs of UT, one for unpatched 436 servers and one for new 451 servers.\nOne way around this is to keep a minimal install of UT separate for online play. Fewer mods means fewer false alarms. UT runs faster and smoother too.\nI think someone’s using one, what do I do? The best way is to disconnect from the game and reconnect as a spectator (tick the spec box in player setup). Click your way through the players until you find your suspect.\nOpen console and type “behindview 0” and you should have a players-eye view.\nAlso a good idea to type “demorec suspectcheat” to record a demo and gain some proof. (Will create the file “suspectcheat.dem” in your unreal/system directory which can be viewed later by typing “demoplay suspectcheat”)\nNow sit back and watch for telltales.\nIf watching a pre-recorded demo, opening console and type “slomo .5” (yes, point five) reduces the gamespeed by half and makes it much easier to spot telltales. Return to full speed with “slomo 1”. Note this won’t work if you’re using Demomanager to start a game with ?timebased as that forces a consistent game speed.\nIf the crosshair jerks rapidly from one target to the other, instantly locking on then there is little doubt that he is cheating. Note that the more sophisticated bots will smooth the aiming to make it harder to detect and now even introduce wobble and overshoot.\nIf you’re new to UT then you probably won’t have the experience to tell a good player from a cheater using a sophisticated bot. If in doubt, ask someone else to view your demo or send it to the admin for his opinion.\nSome players have custom skins that make speccing difficult - they plonk the weapon in the middle of the screen so you can’t see what they’re aiming at. If this happens, amend your own setup so “Weapon hand” is set to “Hidden” as you spec or when you watch the demo. Such a skin isn’t proof of cheating on its own, but is sometimes used by cheaters.\nIf they only use instant-hit weapons be more suspect. Aimbots don’t work too well with rockets, flak, slime or razor, though I have heard of an alt-flak bot, and even primary flak is far more effective with a bot close-up. Rockets are most effective when fired at an enemies feet - so someone doing this is not using a bot (unless they’ve temporarily disabled it).\nUpdate April, 2005: Bots can now aim rockets at enemies feet. Instant rocket fire enabled, automatically turns off for grenades and redeemeer, senses max range of weapon and doesn’t track/fire at enemies beyond the range of the weapon.\nIt is difficult to judge fairly. The more canny botters will switch to different weapons, or switch off the bot if they think they’re being spectated.\nIf the player doesn’t play like a great player but still scores highly, be more suspect. A good player will work the map, usually dodge a great deal and play both offensively and defensively. Yer average aimbotter (see profile below) is a newbie who hasn’t got the skills to fully play the game and so uses a bot to gain what he thinks is respect.\nBecause of the way UT works, where you aim is where you’re facing. If your suspect is running along a gantry and suddenly locks onto a target and continues running off the gantry, or falls into slime or lava, we’ve either got a complete muppet (who will have a crap score) or a botter (who has a high score).\nIf a player is wearing a clantag give them more respect if it is a genuine clan. Clan play is the highest level of UT skill and if you normally only play offline or even on public servers you simply will not believe how good some people can be without cheating. Someone wearing a clan tag is also wearing his reputation and if it’s worth anything he will not risk it by being caught cheating. This isn’t proof on its own however, it’s not unknown for somebody to wear someone else’s nick and tag. There are ways of reconciling the name a botter uses and what their real identity is using irc. However - there are at least two aimbot clans who wear tags: [DD] / [D2] and *69* - Anyone using those tags is almost guaranteed to be cheating.\nSomeone accused me of using a bot! If you’re not, well done. It means you’re a skilled player. Take it as a compliment. If the accuser keeps on going on about it, just ignore him. If he gets other players wound up and they kick you, just move onto another server. Players who willingly believe aimbot accusations with no other proof are probably newbies and not worth your time anyway. You could be being lame simply by playing amongst lower skilled players. Find someone worthy to fight.\nWhy didn’t Epic make cheating harder? Ask them. They didn’t take the reports of cheating particularly seriously and did nothing to make it harder for cheats. They are also failing to release certain sections of the source code even four years later to allow the anti-cheat writers more freedom.\nUpdate: Epic have released the source code to UT to a voluntary development group who aim to fix some of the loopholes in UT’s code to make cheating harder, and also to fix various other bugs. Learn more at the UTPG site. Nice one, Epic.\nUpdate 07: UTPG released a couple of buggy patches which introduced quite a few problems whilst solving others but haven’t done any work for over three years. I think it’s safe to assume dev for UT99 is dead.\nLoque Loque is a standard UT bot. His accuracy is 100%. When playing at most skill levels this accuracy is modifed by UT to a lesser degree, but play him at Godlike level and he will never fail to hit you with an instant hit weapon. Loque is an aimbot user. He uses the same code that aimbots use. Because UT has single-player support it has routines for the bots to identify and aim at targets. Aimbots use this very code. If Epic had made it impossible for this code and similar code to target an enemy or aim during multiplayer games then aimbots would probably not exist for UT, or at least, not in the numbers they do.\nWhat happens when you play Loque on “Skilled” level\nYou’re talking crap, I use one and think it’s great! Then you’re a very sad person. Read the profile below. You’re also confirming to yourself that you lack the skill to compete with other players. You’re not competing, you’re not playing the game, you’re just laming. Got no pride?\nOne thing you may not be aware of is the security risks you’re taking. Think you’re 7334? Ever looked at the source code to some of these bots? Might surprise you to see the amount of backdoors some of these bots have and what they can do. If you’re truly elite you will know about backdoors and trojans and will take the precaution of checking the code to see what it can do - it’s not good for the image to get 0wn3d by someone else’s bot. If you don’t know how to do this, you’re just another wannabe. This isn’t bluff, I’ve downloaded and disassembled perhaps a dozen different bots. Six had droppers in the installer. Seven were unusable in any circumstances on any server using any version of CSHP/Pure. ALL of the ones I checked could be caught by ASH, even if you hadn’t turned it on.\nThink you can avoid being caught by using someone else’s nick? Yeah, quite a few players thought that too - until they were caught, their IP was traced to their irc nick/website/computer/IM etc and their real identities revealed.\nOh, and if you do get caught, please try to be more original in your excuses. “It was my brother/sister/friend/dog/cat” just doesn’t work. Or in the case of ASH finding known binds in your ini, PLEASE try to think of something better than “Well, I tried it once but it’s been deleted now…” Yah, right.\nExcuses, excuses…\nBut I suck! And you guys are so good I don’t stand a chance! We all sucked at first. Good players have put a great deal of time into learning the skills required to stay alive in UT. That is the point of a game. Games are about pitting your skills against another player, nothing else. _Learn!\n_You will get more respect from other players if you try. Acting like a little kid by shouting abuse and/or cheating won’t get you any. It’s like walking into a premier league football match and expecting to be able to score a goal against professionals, and believe me, there are players that treat UT like a full-time job.\nI’m curious and want to try one! I shan’t tell you where to get one, but if you merely want to see how they work, feel free to get one and try it offline. Nobody cares what cheats you use offline because you’re not hurting anyone. Please fight the temptation to take it online though, and it’s safer to install it on a separate install of UT - otherwise you may find yourself caught by ASH and Pure and labelled as a cheater. You will lose all respect from your fellow players, probably get kicked from your clan, your clan may get kicked from any leagues it is in and basically your life in the UT Community will be hell. Be safe, don’t take it or that copy of UT online. In fact, disable internet access for that install - backdoors and trojans being what they are. If you find one that only works online against servers running cshp or pure, don’t risk it.\n(Note - this is probably unsafe now as some anticheat software will scan directories outside of UnrealTournament’s and if you have a known bot anywhere on your computer it might end up with a ban.)\nInstagib Instagib is a popular mod that has only one weapon - the Enhanced Shock Rifle (ESR) that kills with one hit. Aimbots seem to be most popular on insta-servers because it’s so instantly effective. It’s also pretty obvious - but again, you need to temper your suspicion to begin with. Some players, even me, have runs where everything works and it seems like you can’t miss. Demos (never willingly released by a true botter) and specs are the only way to be sure - as above, look for sudden changes in direction, running off gantries and so on.\nOther cheats ASMD combo The ASMD combo occurs when the secondary plasma ball is hit by the primary beam, resulting in a large radius and high damage explosion. There is a cheat that will allow the user to always hit his secondary ball which is a very difficult manoeuvre to make when not cheating. Easy to detect though; Their crosshair will follow the secondary throughout it’s path. A good player will usually move his crosshair to where he wants the explosion to occur and then shoot the ball when it arrives. Also watch when an ASMD whore gets caught in close-up fighting where it’s not effective and goes into alt-fire spam mode. If the cursor is still tracking the alt-fire balls it’s almost certainly a cheat.\nSpec cheat There is a bug in UT that allows somebody to connect to a server as a spectator yet still interact with the map. Normally they just fly around and can’t touch anything. With this cheat they can collect a flag and fly it from one end of the map to the other without being seen and without the flag being seen - all you will see is the flag colour glow when it passes next to walls. They can also park themselves under a lift and prevent that lift from being lowered - this is devastating in CTF-Command at blue base where nobody can get up with the other flag. They can also select the impact hammer and use it.\nBecause they are a spectator they cannot be killed. At all. Totally invulnerable. Their name does not appear in the scores list either, nor do they score points. However, if you pass your crosshair over where they are then sometimes their name appears onscreen. People using this cheat are doing it simply to disrupt the game. It is a deliberate exploit of a bug, it can’t happen by accident.\nAs a player there is nothing you can do other than log the time and notify the server admin (address gained by pressing F2). Then tell the other players and leave the server to find an honest game. If the admin doesn’t fix his server, vote with your feet.\nShieldbelt cheat A bug in UT allows a player to gain the shieldbelt when it respawns even when they’re nowhere near it. As far as I’ve been able to tell this is a genuine bug and hasn’t been exploited by a cheater, it simply happens to a random player. Never seen it myself so can’t give much detail, sorry.\nInvis and skin-cheats Within a week of UT being released there was a skin cheat that made the player truly invisible. (Not like the invis powerup). I’ve not seen it in the wild, and the author claimed not to have released it - but it’s pretty obvious when it happens. The only way you’ll know someone is there is from sound, weaponfire or their name coming up when you pass your cursor over them. Other skin cheats include all-black skins and rainbow skins. These by themselves aren’t a great problem, but they’re often used with other cheats and in my experience suggest the player’s a muppet and potential cheat - it’s a way of saying “I’m better than you - look at me!” which is the mentality that seeks aimbots.\nToday (12 July, 2002) I discovered a new DM/LMS variant on the publics. The chameleon skin. It changed the player team of the user rapidly from red, blue, gold and green. It also used the name-hack that scrolled the name (rapid setname adding and subtracting the letters of the name). This player wasn’t using an aimbot (I specced him and then went on to beat him), just being lame and annoying. He was actually a pretty good player, but suffered from the “look at me” syndrome.\nFreakscene has this to say: I used to run the Jamison/Gold CTF server during the first year after UT’s release. I saw this invisibility cheat in action while I was playing on Coret one night. The player was totally invisible, but the playername (which I have forgotten) showed up when the crosshairs passed over him.\n“That guy’s in my team, but he’s in the other teams’ colours! WTF?” Xan-II skin colour bug. Known and that’s why that skin is banned in league play despite it being a standard one. Only seems to happen in certain maps (CTF-Andaction certainly, but others too).\n“That guy’s carrying a flag when I know he’s not!” This is a genuine bug in UT. Can appear to carry either flag but doesn’t have the associated glow of a true flag carrier. Most weird. Again, happens a lot in CTF-Andaction and worse when things are laggy. Nearly always seen with the high details skin like Xan][.\n“Things seem laggier when this guy appears in my view!” Some skins, like the high detail Nali skin, can cause lag to other players if their computer isn’t too fast. Not a cheat, but using these skins at clan level is often considered lame. But it’s easy for someone to turn them off - just tick “Mods” -\u003e “Use default actors” in UT and you’ll never see another Nali or stupid Cow.\nHere is a recent (September 05) screenshot from a player taken in game using UTDC’s automatic screenshot grabber (players don’t know when screens are being taken and sent to server). It shows clearly a brightskin cheat in use. The other player is glowing with their team colour and obviously this gains a huge advantage in identifying and locating targets.\nExample brightskin to highlight other players\nTriggerbot Far more subtle than the aimbot. It doesn’t aim. Instead it waits until the target passes under the crosshair and then fires the weapon for you. Very difficult to confirm. Used mainly in instagib games. I’ve seen demos of this in operation but never encountered, or at least been able to prove, this online myself. Some say this is far more common than aimbots, but is so difficult to prove most people won’t realise. To test for, go into 1st person spec. Player often waves their mouse around a lot faster than normal. Big give-away with the most common trigger bot is that it’s colour-triggered; if an enemy wearing a particular colour is under the cursor it fires. It also fires if scenery of that same colour is under the trigger! Take Ctf-Dreary, the team banners, or some other maps where the walls have decorations in strong blue or red colours. I’ve just watched a high-profile demo (iD.Pain caught, his whole clan removed from the cup and not allowed to enter any more cups on Clanbase). The player would suddenly fire at the wall for no good reason other than it was the same colour. A good human player wouldn’t do that, they know the maps. The trigger bot thinks “I’ve been set to fire at Blue targets, there’s some blue under my cursor, let’s fire.”\nRadar Some mods allow a small display onscreen that shows the positions of other players nearby. Nearly impossible to prove but if somebody always has a shock-combo or full load or rockets waiting for you as you come around a corner it can make you suspicious that they know you’re coming. However - do not assume this; there are other clues for a good player to know you’re coming such as sound, you’re playing too predictably (always coming the same way, for example) or they’re just spamming like mad.\nNote: This is not like in Tactical Ops where a radar is part of an official mod, not an add-on for a game type where it was never intended.\nTimers Basically an addition to the HUD that works out when certain items will respawn, like the Shield belt, Keg, armour etc. Difficult to prove, although ASH can catch some common ones.\nSound hacks I don’t know of any in UT, but they probably exist given that they do for other FPS games. A script takes the information supplied by ESP/3d sound to pinpoint the location of a nearby player, then plots their position on a HUD radar.\nSee-through walls, AKA “Wallhack” A certain graphics card manufacturer released drivers for its card that boasted that it would enable the player to see other players through walls in some 3d games. They hurriedly tried to cover it up but the damage was done and other drivers for different cards have now appeared that give the same results. I once had this happen to me innocently in Quake where a broken driver setup allowed me to see other players coming, most odd. Test as radar.\nLag-cheat Unusual, of specialised use yet used in the field quite widely. What basically happens is the player changes his netspeed frequently, from very low (1000) to very high (10,000). This messes up his connection and he lags. Why do this? Because hitting a lagging person is more difficult. It’s used mostly for flag carriers. They won’t be able to hit a damned thing, but it makes them much harder to hit themselves because they’re not where they appear to others. (Especially in insta or when using non-splash weapons). This has been used in clan games, but cheaters beware - the server logs netspeed changes so the admin WILL know you’ve done it, and clan ladders are now aware of this situation and will disqualify your team. (One recent game showed a player changing netspeed several hundred times in one game) Note that the Pure 56+ will kick a player if his netspeed changes more than 10 times in one game. Also the utpg 451 patch will disallow netspeed changes quicker than 15 seconds.\nSliding Players Not a cheat, really - but some think it is so worthy of a mention here. It’s a bug with UT when you install the “Compressed Textures” from CD-2. If the server doesn’t run them, or there is a conflict, then other players slide about instead of moving, and when dead still stand upright (until gibbed). It’s a problem with *your* setup, just remove the textures (Control Panel -\u003e Add/Remove -\u003e UnrealTournament -\u003e Compressed textures)\nHitbox / Hard to kill Lots of rumour, little fact. Apparently there is a way you can adjust your hitbox that makes you harder to hurt in normal weapon games. Quite possibly the same as “stone skin” cheats that make you harder to hurt. This could simply be a lag / packet loss / tickrate issue, or it could be a cheat - I simply don’t know.\nMessage Hacks Not seen much now - beaten by most anti-cheat mods. Allowed a user to “Super Say” messages right across the screen when not logged in as admin. Very annoying.\nFeign Death Cheat Note, this is not the “trick” whereby you can charge the GES, feign death and then release the goo.\nI haven’t personally encountered this, but a couple of folks from alt.games.unreal.tournament have. I’ll let them speak now:\nDragonAsh: Dunno how it was done, but it definitely messed with the the hit zone of the model. Also, he used it with a speed hack. Basically, the person was feigning death while moving. Couldn’t hit him for shit\nGoPostal: It’s kind of hard to explain, flash. The dude I saw was hitting the ground so fast there were only a couple of frames where he was falling down, and then he would pop back up just as fast. It wasn’t the “swimming” posture that fly invokes, but a lying down form. He would do this back and forth and I think it moved the kill box so fast that most hits wouldn’t register. Never could get any blood to show from hitting him. It was really aggravating….\nAs I say, I haven’t seen this myself so can’t vouch for it existing or not being caused by a bug. One possibility, raised by Archangel is that this is only seen by people with the 2nd-CD compressed textures installed (“Sliding Players”, above), which kinda makes sense. If that is the case, it ain’t a cheat….\nDodge Bind Since UT was released people have been trying to write a keybind that lets them dodge with one key. As far as I know, this hasn’t been achieved - except possibly with some programmable controllers (like keypads etc). Without cheating some players can dodge frequently and repeatedly, so don’t think of it as a cheat. The server controls the pause between dodges too, and if you see someone dodging too quickly, it’s probably a dodge-jump-dodge combo. Some might not even consider this a cheat anyway, given that the Hammer-Jump bind is so accepted in Assault.\nUpdate 13/4/03: It’s been confirmed and in use. By addressing the windows API directly the cheat can dodge continually - usually forward in insta-ctf/dom to gain speed.\nThat guy’s nicked my name! At least one aimbot package, and at least one standalone script have the ability to steal your name, or the name of any other player in the game, changing it slightly or adding an invisible space so that it looks the same. Doesn’t necessarily mean he’s using a bot, but it is pretty damned lame. Often used at end-game by aimbotters to brag.\nOther Cheats\nThere are lots of little things that are pretty obvious - like a player firing 3 redeemers in rapid succession (unless the redeemer-arena mod is enabled, you can only carry two deemers). Or when a player dies, two relics appear - including one you’re already carrying. (Note some mods like Pinata can alter this kind of stuff, so check first.) (Thx to Sixdarts for info on these).\nThere are also cheats that:\nChange cheaters’ name constantly. Steals your name (adding invis character to make it different and harder to kick) Bypass Antibv (stops players using Behindview) Stops view shaking when hit. Removes the sound of players footsteps. Shows enemies health in HUD. Bypass Anticv (centre view). Changes max distance before you get someone’s info on-screen. Shows enemies locations in scoreboard (like for your own team). Remove rocket smoke. Constant taunts (typically Xan ones) Zoom with any weapon. Constant suicides. (For ruining your teams score in TDM) Constant skin changer. And more… Some of these may seem fairly trivial, but to my way of thinking they are ALL cheats and if found (many of these can be) in a multiplayer game you WILL be treated as a cheater. Don’t use these things if you have any honour at all.\nSome fallacies about cheats “Ping kills aimbots”\nFirst generation bots would suffer online because they couldn’t compensate for a medium-high ping the way a human can. Modern bots can and do - automatically checking your ping and adjusting in front or behind the target. It’s still not perfect, and a high-pinger will still have problems using a bot.\n“He shot rockets out of his ass!”\nAimbots don’t allow you to do this. If someone appears to be shooting in a direction other than they are facing, it’s probably down to lag at your end, his or the server. And because of the way UT firing works, someone doing that probably isn’t using one - if they can load a few rockets facing one way, then flip, fire, and flip back - that’s skill.\n“Ducking stops an aimbot from hitting me!”\nActually, semi-true. If the bot is configured to only go for headshots, it will miss you if you duck since you then don’t have a “head target” visible. But newer ones go for body sometimes anyway to reduce tell-tales and some will deliberately miss to make them harder to track. This did work for me against a insta-bot user in command. I simply crawled right up to his feet with him shooting over my head. Note that if you’re lower or higher than the bot, or if ping is altering the bot’s use, you may get hit anyway. Newer bots can be configured to go only for bodyshots or a combination.\n“They’re moving too fast!”\nSo far as I know, there is no way a client-side hack can alter speed of movement. Good players dodge all the time and move through the map efficiently and effectively. I’ve been playing UT for 2 years and thought I’d seen it all, yet last night I went up against a player who seemed to be everywhere and moved superbly. No cheats, just skill.\nSome server side mods like Relics can alter speed so take that into account.\nUpdate 07: Speed-hack is proven and UTDC will catch it. Unfortunately, it is quite often done unintentionally with modern power saving CPU modes (speed-stepping). UT checks the CPU speed on startup - sometimes the CPU is in low power mode and reports it’s current speed instead of maximum speed. As UT runs, the CPU hops out of power saving and gives full speed resulting in UT running too fast. In most games this isn’t a problem - the server caps their speed. However - with some mods like Strangelove the speed is controlled by a mutator which doesn’t check for abuse resulting that someone using a Speedhack, either deliberately or accidentally - will fly a rocket much faster than anyone else.\nUTDC Logs speedhacks and will report deliberate hacks seperately, so you can tell when somebody’s trying to gain an advantage this way.\nIf you run SLV or similar mods, I recommend telling UTDC to kick speedhackers rather than the default Log only.\nTo force UT to run at the maximum speed of your processor - use the commandline “-cpuspeed=1800” where 1800 is the maximum Mhz.\n“They’re loading rockets too fast!”\nAgain, this is server-controlled. It cannot be changed by a bot. If you hear a player loading rockets and it sounds too fast, it’s probably lag affecting you, him or the server and your client trying to catch up.\n“He shot me right across the map - that’s impossible!”\nNo, it’s not. Many gamers have high-spec machines, run huge monitors, low world detail and high res. Such shots can and are made on skill alone.\n“That cheater made my computer crash!”\nSo far as I know, that’s impossible. Using a bot yourself may do that, but remotely - unless your system is wide open anyway (Hint: Use a decent firewall at all times) and you have backdoors running, they can’t touch you or your computer. Normal computer housekeeping will keep you safe (running anti-virus and anti-spyware scans)\n“My connection died - it’s all his fault!”\nWell, maybe. I used to think this was highly unlikely, but a CTF cup match run by Clanbase suffered a DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack during a game recently that affected several players (from different countries and ISPs) from one team AND the admin, so badly they couldn’t play or even connect. It’s widely known that “Zombies” running on multiple machines (why don’t people use firewalls and anti-virus software?) allow their connections to repeatedly ping a specific IP. Now, does this affect you? When you’re playing UT online, your IP address is not known to the other players. It IS known to the admin, so a hacked server could give this information. It can also show up clearly if you’re connected to IRC at the same time (probably what happened in the above). This isn’t an aimbot issue, but it definitely is a cheating one - although maybe not by anyone playing.\n“He shot me through the bloody wall!”\nNot a cheat, it’s a bug in some of UT’s maps. Sometimes the textures of wall joints don’t line up properly, leaving an invisible but relevant gap. Weapons with big splash damage (flak, rocket, shock, GES) can damage you if you’re next to such a bug. Because of this, and some other bugs in maps, some servers run “CE” (Clan Edition) versions of the same maps that fix these bugs and maybe, as in the case of CTF-November-CE, the inequality of the bases. Do be aware that lag may show you to be in one place (say, safely behind a wall) but the server thinks you’re somewhere else - so this may also be the problem.\n“He slid into a wall and I couldn’t kill him!”\nIt’s lag. The player has either just lost his connection or is about to. The server is trying to show you where it thinks he is, but doesn’t know so won’t register your kill. Can be a sign of the lag-cheat above, but generally it means they’re about to say goodbye.\n“He caused my server to crash!”\nYes, possible. One good thing UTPG did do with v451 was fix a massive hole that allowed a malicious player to crash a server on join. (Bug exploit)\nHowever - such exploits still exist and are in use. IP or subnet ban your best defence.\nNote: Under UK law this constitutes a “Denial of service attack” and is a criminal offence.\nWhy do you know so much about it? No, I don’t cheat online. I never have and never will. If I can’t win fairly then I would rather not win. (In fact, I demonstrate my skill at not winning regularly. :))\nI know a lot about cheats because they have affected how I play the game. I have had games spoiled by them and I’ve made it my business to learn as much as possible about the tools they use so I can fight against them. This means lurking in cheating and anti-cheating forums, hex editing and decompiling scripts and bots to see how they work. You may be amused to learn that quite a lot of the cheating stuff I’ve downloaded has been infected with viruses and trojans, and several of the most well-known bots have backdoors coded into them, so using a bot is risky not just to the reputation.\nI’ve been a public UT server admin for about four years now, helping first Truff’s and now Multiplay’s public UT, UT2k4 and UT3 servers. Banning cheats is much of what I do. “Know thy enemy”\nI’ve also run a UT server on my LAN to test these things to see how they work, and if they work against current anti-cheat software.\nI repeat, I have NEVER used a bot online, never gone online with a copy of UT that had been tainted. You will not catch me, because I have nothing to catch! Nice feeling, that. I may suck, I might get beaten, but I have righteousness on my side. I respect those who beat me fairly and I respect those who can lose without whining. I still enjoy most games of UT. I still enjoy annoying and shaming cheaters.\nProfile of a cheater So who cheats? Who are these faceless people who enjoy spoiling the games of others?\nMostly kids, is what. Pubescent boys (always boys, as far as I can tell) who spend too much time with their computers and have little or no social skills. No, I don’t think I’m just belittling them because they’re “the enemy”, I’m pretty sure that’s the truth. I’ve talked with a few and played against a few. They normally have short attention spans, have a huge desire for ‘respect’ from others that is born of their real life inadequacies, have problems forming relationships, are inarticulate and near-illiterate and are incredibly selfish. I stress that last because it is truly selfish to spoil the games of others for your own pleasure.\nThere are exceptions to this. I had an enlightening conversation with an intelligent and articulate 23 year old cheater. He understood totally why he cheated and made no apologies. He knew he was being annoying and simply did not care. The older cheaters seem to do it to get a reaction, rather than for “respect”. As computer games go on, more older cheaters exist because they’ve become so dependant on cheating that they cannot enjoy a game without an unfair advantage. It can get to be a genuine addiction for some. Instead of enjoying and learning a new game, they immediately seek cheats for it.\nThey seem to have a big hole in their logic, too. Presumably someone with such a desire for respect has some pride. What’s the pride in knowing your skill is so weak you must rely on artificial aids? What happens when you’re caught cheating, what price respect then? How will it feel when your mates learn you feel so badly about your own abilities that you cheated against them? How will it feel when you’re kicked from your clan and nobody will ever want you in theirs again?\nA skilled UT player normally doesn’t cheat. They may use lame tactics occasionally (spawnkilling, spamming, camping) but to become a skilled player in UT you need to be able to learn from other better players, and to me the biggest thrill and the best games I’ve ever had have been when I’ve been up against a great player and managed to beat them, or even come close. That is a feeling a cheater will never experience because they are not pitting themselves against the other, just their software. It’s like getting a new game and immediately looking for the cheats for it. What’s the point?\nAnd that is why a cheater is a sad person. Their lives are hollow and meaningless. They crave attention and gain it by the cheapest means possible.\nIt’s not the winning that matters, it is the taking part. If you cheat you are not a part of the game.\nPictures Exhibit A, m’lud\nA picture of a match I played yesterday (02-Nov-2002). Note high-scorer on Blue. Was playing insta-ctf as Elvis (badly) until near the end when he suddenly went godlike. Note aimbot brag where it was taking other players names and setnaming itself - fairly common. I know the bot used, but won’t name it here.\nExhibit B, m’lud\nAnother recent one. Note score. Ok, fair enough, mostly newbies on that server, but that score just ain’t realistic; and botters using the same name as stock UT bots are kinda giving you a hint. Ignore high ping - this was end-game and people taking screenies will upset normal ping ratings - Nikita had a sub-100 ping during game.\nThere is only ONE allowable aimbot\nOther links Note - most of these links are now dead\nClanbase catches a high-profile cheater, ID:Pain\nClanbase catches another cheater, BB:Satan\nComments, bitches, corrections, additions etc - (Guestbook disabled due to muppets) Contact me via the forum please, I don’t want to continue getting aimbot requests via email.\nInspired by Money for Nothing, Dire Straits, /Brothers in arms/ 1985\nOriginal lyrics by Mark Knopfler \u0026 Sting\nCopyright this parody : XandreX , 2003.09.14\n*Frags for nothing*\nI want my UT pure………\nNow look at them yoyos, that's the way you do it You keep hiding while on L.M.S.

Some parts of this faq are seriously outdated. Update April, 2005: I did some more checking to see what was out there now. From what I’m hearing, most of the UT cheat writers have now left UT alone and moved up to UT2k4, but one or two still exist. Private cheats (the hardest to block) are rumoured to still be in existence, but the likes of Pure, UTDCC, qValidate etc apparently now kill all, or almost all, publically available cheats",

Trust me on this. Designate 1 of the 3 CPs to each person, and\nplace the remaining 2 players at the busier CP’s.\nEg, A typical 5v5 nw dom tactic for Dom-Olden would be: 2 players\nlower CP. 1 player Mid CP. 1 Player upper CP. 1 player giving support\nto upper and mid.\nSB, powerup control is important on some maps so learn them.

    "content": "About this Website History Digital Dilemma is a name used by it’s creator, Simon Avery, since 1990 relating to computer related services.\nEarly 1990s – Round Corner Software / Digital Dilemma I founded and ran a Shareware company that distributed cassette tapes and 3″ 178Kb disks of Public Domain / Shareware Software for the Amstrad CPC. Some of it was my own text adventures, but mostly other peoples’ games. Back then, this was the standard way to distribute software that wasn’t on sale in the local shops. People would request some titles, I’d copy them to either cassette tape or 3\" floppy Disks for the Amstrad CPC and post them off in a jiffy bag, charging around £3 a diskfull. It was never meant to make money, just to cover the postage costs.\nEarly 1990s to around 2005 – Digital Dilemma BBS. Also Fidonet 2:255/90 and 2:255/0 When I first upgraded my 1200/75 modem to a 14.4kbps one, I started to run a BBS. This required renting a dedicated phone line from BT (not a cheap thing back then). It was fun to listen to the click of the modem when it answered a call and then go and see what the user was doing. Whether they were downloading files, playing one of the Door Games like Lord of the Green Dragon, or reading messages.\nI eventually got further into messaging and ran a point system from another BBS. From there, I applied and was granted my own node number, 2:255/90 (UK, Regional Southwest). Fidonet mail was generally sorted into different topics and each downlink would require an archive created containing the mail topics they’d subscribed to, plus any direct email (called netmail) for them or their users. Because every phone call was chargeable, this was optimised and automated to be as efficient as possible. Highly compressed files created ready to be collected and even with the low linespeeds of the day, a typical send and receive would be done in a few seconds. We don’t need that level of efficiency nowadays, with fast, always-on connections. I still have some software I wrote to help this available here.\nThere were also multiple other mail networks, many specialist-interest or more lax than Fidonet’s rather stuffy rules – topics were always moderated and kept on-topic. (With the exception of CONTROV, a lawless wild place!) I forget the name of many of them now – but Landnet was one, and Blush Response ran its own network, BlushNet and I’m still in touch with many from there even now.\nSometimes around 2000, the main UK Mail Coordinator, John Burden, retired through ill health and I took over the role. He had run a Midnight Line to bring mail into the UK and send it out to other countries. A Midnight Line was a product sold by BT where, for an hour a day, phone calls anywhere were not directly charged. Instead, you paid a fixed fee and I understand that was considerable.\nBy that time, ISDN was available for home use and Digital Dilemma had BT’s Home Highway product, which allowed for 2x 64kbps simultaneous, bonded connections (for the cost of two phone calls!). This was much superior for data transfer as not only was it faster than the fastest 56kbps modem, there was no lengthy modem negotiation. ISDN connected within 1 second and the entire call was often over by the time a modem had finished connecting - which was important when you were paying by the second!\nEventually, Fidonet throughput trickled away as people moved onto the internet and sometime around 2005 when it was only getting 2 or 3 calls a day, I closed Digital Dilemma, cancelled Home Highway and managed to get an always on ADSL connection at 512/128 kbps.\nWebsites The first Digital Dilemma website appeared on the internet around 1995 as a free btinternet site.

    "description": "About this Website History Digital Dilemma is a name used by it’s creator, Simon Avery, since 1990 relating to computer related services.\nEarly 1990s – Round Corner Software / Digital Dilemma I founded and ran a Shareware company that distributed cassette tapes and 3″ 178Kb disks of Public Domain / Shareware Software for the Amstrad CPC. Some of it was my own text adventures, but mostly other peoples’ games. Back then, this was the standard way to distribute software that wasn’t on sale in the local shops. People would request some titles, I’d copy them to either cassette tape or 3\" floppy Disks for the Amstrad CPC and post them off in a jiffy bag, charging around £3 a diskfull. It was never meant to make money, just to cover the postage costs.",

    "content": "Cooling servers using household plumbing\n“How to water cool computers using household plumbing equipment”\nI like peace and quiet. Most water cooling rigs available for home PCs are anything but – they only use water to move the heat away from the CPU and GPU to a finned radiator, then blast it with fans. I thought that radiant cooling would work and not need any fans, so I built a water cooling system. It worked perfectly for a linux server and my gaming windows PC for three years, until I had to free up space and instead focussed on sound proofing a cupboard and using air cooling. This was back in 2010 but there’s no reason why it wouldn’t work today.\nNote: This was a project I did around 2010. Prices have increased since then. The plan I made a plan\nThis shows the initial plan of using a 22mm to 10mm 4-way adapter. In practice, my piping leaked here, so I used a flow and return circuit of 22mm copper, reducing to 15mm and then onto flexible pipe\nThe Equipment Mostly household heating equipment\nI had most of this lying around after fixing various household heating problems. All standard UK wet central heating equipment.\nThe only non-standard bit were the CPU and GPU water heatsinks. They cost around £10 each, second hand from ebay.\nTotal additional cost was about £95 – this was for the radiator, pipe and the heatsinks.\nThe pump is a standard UK central heating pump. These are ceramic and designed to run 24/7 pumping water up to 80’c and use around 25 watts at speed setting 1 of 3. The radiator is a small standard single pane radiator. This barely ran above room temperature (whgich is 15-30c), so oversized was it. It could have coped with at least six CPUs and GPUs. Bear in mind that all the piping is also radiating away heat, so by the time it gets to the rad it’s already dropped a few degrees. Test fitting it in the garage Putting things together where a small leak doesn’t matter\nTo explain this: The black plastic tank is the “header”, containing water to fill the white pipe and allows and air in the system to vent. Fresh tap water contains a surprising amount of air which takes time to settle out. This tank needn’t be as big as this – but I had this spare.\nThen water flows IN to the red central heating pump. Having the air vent before this allows much of the air to escape before hitting the pump. This causes about the only noise this system creates and lowers efficiency of the pumping, since the bubbles act as little pressure-absorbers. Handbooks will tell you about cavitation risk here, which might damage the impeller as well as creating noise, but I consider this risk very small given the speed and low temperature of this water. But it’s still good to avoid anyway.\nAfter the pump, the water would go to the “Cold” side of the 15mm copper manifold (not shown here), and after passing through the heatsinks, would go ito the “Hot” manifold which then led to the Radiator.\nBoth inlet and outlet of this rad is on the bottom, so some air will collect at the top and can be bled away with a normal radiator key. (Once running for a while, the water loses its air content and no further bleeding will be needed until you introduce fresh water – just like a wet central heating system)\nTesting the CPU block\nThis shows one of the heat sinks being tested for pressure and stepping down in pipe sizes. Note the metal sleeves inside the joint – this worked well as the pressure really is very small. Warming up the pipe ends in a cup of hot water allowed them to soften enough to form a snug fit.\nI made a simple manifold to be able to feed multiple blocks\nThis shows one manifold created for two computers. Then the return flow speed from one block. It’s not much, but doesn’t need to be.\nThe return water into the header tank showing relatively low flow\nOverall these tests in a safe place were very useful to gain an understanding of how best to get this running together. Fitting it together in place\nFirst fit\nThis shows the header tank and radiator in position, and the manifolds present on the lower right hand side inside a cupboard. You can see the clear pipes leading up from them to the computers above. (Stained red from a relatively small amount of rust in the system. This didn’t affect operation and turned out just to be a thin coating on the pipes, with clear water after a few days)\nMy linux server at the time\nThis is my linux server running very naked. You can see the flexible pipe coming into the cpu block. The hdd’s are on elastic to reduce vibration noise. I still run naked machines nowadays, even with cpu fans, as I have a nice soundproof place to put them. Cases aren’t needed if you can limit physical access, and this removes the need for a case fan entirely, as non-hotspot sources of heat radiate upwards naturally.\nIn and Out Manifolds mounted below the shelf holding the computers\nA close-up of the manifolds. Cold comes in from the radiator, Hot leaves to the pump. Each vertical section has a service valve that allows you to isolate supply entirely for one computer without affecting the other.\nMy Windows desktop PC with CPU and GPU cooled\nThis was my windows PC, a gaming computer. Here the Cold supply comes into the blue CPU heatsink and then leaves to feed the GPU heatsink before returning to the Cold manifold. My view was that it’s more important to cool the cpu first, but in reality the flow was enough so that it didn’t really matter. The GPU didn’t run much hotter than the CPU.\nLegions heatsinks before fitting\nThis shows the same heatsinks before fitting them, so I could test for leaks and flow.\nResults Results\nAnd some test results. This was a 2-core CPU running ‘stress’ to give some load, and as you can see the cpu temps are barely above ambient. I don’t think this machine ever went above 30’c cpu temp during the several years of this operation. This machine would normally run at 50-60c when aircooled\nThoughts I enjoyed this project and the benefits it brought for several years. The pump never failed and was almost silent in operation (except for air bubbles and the very faintest hum). I never had a leak nor had any failures whatsoever, but obviously that is a risk with any wet system. The biggest noise was the PSU fan, but with 120mm fans and choosing ‘quiet’ models I deemed it acceptable.\nEventually I upgraded the GPU on my gaming PC and I couldn’t find a compatible water block for it (remember this was before water cooling was as popular as it is now) and so I regretfully removed the kit. I replaced the linux server with an HP ML110 which went in an outbuilding, so that was no longer a noise source.\nI still run my desktop in this cupboard without a case, finding it runs cooler than being in a metal box. There’s now a 120mm fan fixed to the wall exhausting warm air to the outside, and the doors are lined with soft foam and thus the noise issue has been solved in a another way. My actual desk is on the other side of the room, with 5m extension leads to a USB hub and the monitors.",

If you happen to have an old car or tractor battery lying around that’s no longer quite good enough to turn an engine over in a cold winter, it would still have enough capacity to run a UPS.\nI’ve done this several times and it’s always worked out well for almost no money.\nNote: Car batteries do emit more hydrogen when charging than SLAs, so only do this in a well ventilated space.\nWhat do you need? A UPS. We’ll restrict ourselves to lower powered consumer UPS’ that use a single 12v SLA battery, although the principles work just as well for larger packs that have 2 or more in serial - just use the equivalent number of 12v batteries, but do make sure they’re close to each other in terms of their own capacity and starting voltage. A 12v lead acid battery. This can be almost anything. The larger the better, and you could add a similar bunch together in parallel to further increase capacity 2x battery clamps or crocodile clips to connect to the car battery. Some thick-guage wire to extend the wiring outside of the UPS to the car battery. Connecting How it goes together\nEnsure your car battery is charged up to at least 12.2v. Resting voltage for a fully charged 12v battery is around 12.6 to 12.8v. Disconnect the UPS from the mains and open it up. Stay away from the circuitry - there’ll be some capacitors in there that can still give a painful and dangerous shock. Disconnect and remove the old SLA battery Extend the positive lead that used to go to the positive terminal on the old battery. This should be of a similar guaged wire and be long enough to reach the positive terminal of the car battery. You may wish to fit an in-line fuse to this, although the UPS will probably already have one. Repeat for the negative lead. Replace UPS covers. You may need to cut a hole in the UPS case, or tail the leads out of the front. When connected, the UPS should go into mains-lost mode and perhaps start beeping.\nAt this point, it should be safe to connect the UPS back into the mains and it should behave exactly as it did with an internal battery.\nIt might look something like this\nVoltage The voltages should be identical to SLA and any diagnostics the UPS may have should look the same for this, once the battery has recharged.\nRuntimes The UPS will probably report disappointing runtimes at first. Once the battery is charged, it’s worth triggering a full calibration. On most UPS’, this disconnects the mains supply and runs the load off the battery until the voltage drops to a specific figure. Then it calculates the load and the duration this took and establishes a new estimated runtime figure. This is something most UPS’ do anyway to remain accurate as the original batteries deteriorate with age. Once that’s complete, the new runtime figure it reports should be longer if the larger battery is in good condition.\nRecharging After being depleted, UPS’ will recharge their battery and this will obviously take longer than a smaller one. They often condition the battery also, so it’s not unusual to see fluctuations of the battery’s voltage as it floats a small charge. Again, this voltage should be similar to the original battery.\nConsiderations Lead acid batteries emit more hydrogen when charging than SLA batteries do, which is explosive. Ensure your space is well ventilated. (I run my server in a garage, which was perfect) If the wiring extension is long, increase guage to avoid voltage drop. (There are various formulas for this)",

GPSLogger is an amazing piece of free software that records GPS tracks on Android very well. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could use GPSLogger to send your position to Traccar? Well, you can, and it’s not hard.\nWhy not just use Traccar’s Android client? A good question, and there’s no reason why not. It (usually) works fine. however, I did have a few issues with it that, whilsts not serious, were enough to steer me towards GPSlogger.\nGPSLogger has more settings for granularity, and those are well documented. One of the devices I was using kept on turning off Traccar-Client and nothing I tried would keep it running for more than an hour. I found GPSLogger was better at dropping GPS Jitter reports from the devices. GPSLogger used less battery for me. Traccar has huge support for a great many devices and software. Whilst it doesn’t support GPSLogger natively, it does provide a simple webhook for OSMand which is easily used. And - critically - I was already using GPSLogger to record GPS tracks whenever I walked or biked somewhere. Please don’t think I’m criticising Traccar or Traccar-Client - I’m sure it works great for many people and I love the project\nAnd one reason not to use GPSLogger: It’s no longer published via Google’s Play store. So you will need to visit the website and download the APK to install it. Some people are understandably nervous about doing this, and some phones won’t let you do so without a lot of fiddling. Fair enough, and Traccar Client is on Play store.\nHow to get GPSLogger reporting your position to Traccar *I’ve been using this method for almost a year with a very good success)\nReferences:\nTraccar documentation for OSMAN type URL paramaters GPSLogger’s parameter reference (Parent) Before you begin Go to your Traccar website, into Settings then Devices and make a note of the Identifier number for the device you’re configuring. This is your USER-ID and you’ll need it later.\nIf you haven’t set up a new Device in Traccar yet, please do so first\nSteps:\nHave a publically accessible URL for your Traccar server. I host Traccar on my private server behind a CGNat, and use a free Cloudflare tunnel to allow remote access to it. Eg: https://tracserver.domain.com\nInstall GPSLogger onto your phone Website *You can either use FDroid, which also keeps it up to date, or just install the latest APK from the GPSLogger website\nNote: GPSLogger is not on Google’s Play store, so you’ll need to use FDroid or install manually via APK – see the GPSLogger site for details\nIn GPSLogger, tap the 3-line menu top-left to enter settings.\nSet your Logging Details up as you want and then navigate to Auto Send, email and upload This section should be left unset for Traccar, but if you’re also sending a GPX file to GDrive or elsewhere, you may already have settings here. Just ensure “Custom URL” in this section is NOT ticked\nReturn to the GPSLogger settings menu and select Custom URL\nTick Log to custom URL\nUNTICK Allow Auto Sending (Otherwise it will repeatedly send the same coords to Traccar until it floods out a few hours later)\nAlso leave Discard offline locations unticked. This way if your connection fails, GPSlogger will keep recording and send those logs to Traccar once network is restored, so you can a decent history log even offline.\nIn URL, put the following, but change two items\nTRACCAR_URL to the public URL of your Traccar server. If you have a specific port you need to use, specify that after the URL and BEFORE the following slash. Eg: https://my-traccar-server-mydomain.com:5505/\nThe USER-ID for your device, as noted earlier. (Change YOUR_ID to that number)\nhttps://TRACCAR_URL/?id=YOUR_ID\u0026lat=%LAT\u0026lon=%LON\u0026hdop=1\u0026altitude=%ALT\u0026speed=%SPD\u0026batt=%BATT\u0026timestamp=%TIMESTAMP\u0026charge=%ISCHARGING\u0026bearing=%DIR I find it easiest to copy and paste these to my email client to get them on the phone, then copy and paste into GPSLogger. You can play around with the parameters as per the Parameter guide on GPSLogger and Traccar’s sites to change what it sends above, but these are quite comprehensive.\nImportant! Under HTTP Method in GPSLogger’s Custom URL settings page, change this from GET to POST\nBack out of the menus and click Start Logging in GPSLogger’s main page. If everything is good, then you should see your device start to update on the page.\nNotes and Problems GPSLogger shows a small blue circle at the top right of its menu when it’s sending and the device should be updated a few seconds after that, at whatever upload frequency you set.\nOpening GPSLogger’s Log View page will show you what it’s doing. If you see any red lines, something broke. Green lines denote a successful send of coordinates.\nTraccar’s logs are quite useful in debugging any problems - tail -f /opt/traccar/logs/tracker-server.log\nFine Tuning Things In GPSLogger’s Settings menu, under Performance you can make a big difference to battery usage by tuning a few items. These are my suggestions;\nLogging interval (How often GPSLogger sends coordinates to Traccar) - No less than 10 seconds. 30-60 is a more normal balance for good battery life.\nDistance filter (If GPSLogger detects you’ve moved less than this distance since it last sent your location to Traccar, it won’t send this time - very useful to save it sending pointless updates and wearing down the battery, and it explains that in the Log View.) I use 4 meters.\nAccuracy filter (If GPSLogger has a weak GPS signal that gives a certainty less than this value, it won’t send a reading to Traccar this time) I set this to 50meters\nDuration to match accuracy) (How long it takes to get a GPS reading should take less than this) I set this to 10 seconds as a good balance to save using too much battery trying to get a fix in a poor signal area.\nOptions ON: Log GPS/GNSS Locations, Choose best accuracy in duration. Every other option left off, apart from those mentioned.\nThat’s it! GPSLogger should be sending your device’s position every Logging interval seconds with a reasonably balance of accuracy and battery life.",

    "content": "Meet Shawn, my Remote Controlled Lawn Mower.\nShawn, 2025\nMore pictures and videos down below About Shawn We own this steep 5-acre field on Dartmoor where we graze our horses. As horses are not very good at grazing off weeds, it needs topping twice a year to keep the grass in good condition. When we bought the land, it was very neglected, with a lot of high bramble growth and bracken which took weeks to clear. As it’s too steep for tractors (Most of it is about 30’, with parts up to 45’) my wife and I did this ourselves using petrol strimmers. It took months of work to get it in a state good enough to call the fencers in, and they too struggled with the grade.\nI did try mowing it with a ride-on mower, and that flipped over backwards on top of me. Then I bought a tracked mini tractor with flail, which was downright scary to drive on those slopes. After a few years of struggling to strim it, I went to the Royal Cornwall Agricultural Show in 2016 and they had a very shiny remote-controlled bank mower on show. I saw this amazing machine and was very excited! But it cost £45,000 so was obviously out of the question. After spending a few months thinking about this, I started to plan building my own. This has led to a project now around a decade long made up of many variations.\nToday, there are a great many more options available, with small versions flooding the market from China for around £2,000. I’m sure these are great, and anything is better than manually strimming this steep ground, especially as one gets older. I’ve probably spent around that on this project overall, although it’s provided a lot of fun and learning by doing it myself.\nSpecifications The current version of Shawn that I’m using to mow the field has these key points:\nA Honda 5.5hp engine from an Alko self-propelled mower, which cost £45 off ebay.\nFour wheelchair motors in two pairs.\nA chassis made mostly from the frame of a home treadmill, reinforced with bits and bobs - like some angle iron, wooden 4x2’s, a strimmer shaft, some plate steel, the handle of the original mower and some water pipe.\nBatteries are similarly mismatched:\n2x ordinary car batteries. (Now quiet weak) 2x Deep cycle electric wheelchair batteries. A 24v pack made up of 12x deep cycle 10AH 12v batteries from a UPS that was replaced. These three “packs” each produce 24v which is combined in a junction box, and connected to the control box with Anderson plugs.\nA Sabertooth motor driver.\nA cheap remote controller.\nA full tank of petrol lasts about 90 minutes, which is about the same time it takes for the batteries to drop below 24v on this steep ground. It’s conveniently the time it takes for me to need a cup of tea. The Batteries take around 6 hours to recharge, so it’s one session a day, which is about half an acre when it’s fairly easy going. The whole 5 acre field takes 10 or so mows to completely do it.\nMistakes made There are many - this has been a long process of learning.\nA big “Stop Button” Burned out on the third day of use. Despite claiming to be able to handle 100 Amps, it melted way before then.\nUngeared 500w motors connected with chains Using mini-moto parts to connect a 500w motor above each wheel connected with chain and sprocket. I just couldn’t get the chains to stay on - my engineering skills weren’t up to making everything align well enough or robust enough to survive.\nSimilarly, using a motorbike chain and sprockets to a single large wheelchair motor to power two wheels on one side didn’t work either. Getting everything to stay aligned proved impossible for more than a few hours.\nSingle front wheel On flat ground, this worked well. Two wheelchair motors at the back and a big castor wheel at the front. But on any kind of rough ground it started to struggle, and taking it onto the steep ground proved it useless. Constantly struggling for torque and the front constantly steering sharply downhill.\nLarge wheels I made large wheels (24\") entirely from metal with spade lugs. These shook themselves apart!\nI then made wooden wheels out of fence rails and gave them angle-iron tyres with bolts screwed in for grip. Again, these worked okay on flat ground, but were not workable on the steep.\nKeeping the original mower deck The first few generations meant trying to fix wheels and motors and controls onto the cast aluminium mower deck. This was really hard as the angles were all over the place. I don’t know why I didn’t think of it before, but removing the engine and putting it on a flat piece of steel, and that onto a rectangular chassis, made life so much easier!\nAdding a strimmer I did mount a strimmer head powered by a 12v motor to the side, so it could trim up against hedges, but 12v was too weak and the positioning too limited.\nUsing a 24v alternator This actually kind of worked. I used the pulley on the centre shaft that was designed to run the mower’s rear wheels and placed an alternator on that - initially at the rear and then at the front to help weight balance. It extended the runtime of the batteries by about 40% but I removed it for two reasons:\nThe alternator would get very hot and start binding. I know this was because I was drawing so much energy for the motors that the alternator was running higher than its rated capacity, and on a hot day in sunlight there wasn’t much cooling to be had. This definitely would work on a smaller, two-motor system on flat ground. I figured it was better to add more batteries instead!\nWith only 5.5hp, the mower struggled too much in long grass when it had to power the alternator as well and would bog down very easily. This was very provable by turning it on and off (I had wired a momentary switch to energise the alternator to get it producing power). I figured it took somewhere between 1 and 2 hp out of the motor so I couldn’t use it on anything but the thinner grass.\nFuture ideas I’m thinking about replacing the chassis at some point to one with less flex. The amount of creaking it does with the weight of the engine and batteries is quite alarming! But so far nothing has snapped too badly.\nPossibly replace the engine with a more powerful one, and that probably means uprating to a ride-on mower type engine of at least 8hp, preferably 12.\nSuspension. I’m not smart enough to design this myself, but something like a child’s ATV chassis might be good. To be able to skid-turn effectively, the layout needs to be close to square, but I’m sure something like this could work well.\nSome way of remotely turning the mower engine on and off. I have electric start on another mower engine, but don’t know how to integrate that into the RC Controller.\nPictures Inside the control box\nBottom A 150A resettable trip (LHS) Main Sabretooth controller (An excellent purchase) (Mid) The receiver (vecrod to the RHS) This provides as much range as I need.

    "description": "Meet Shawn, my Remote Controlled Lawn Mower.\nShawn, 2025\nMore pictures and videos down below About Shawn We own this steep 5-acre field on Dartmoor where we graze our horses. As horses are not very good at grazing off weeds, it needs topping twice a year to keep the grass in good condition. When we bought the land, it was very neglected, with a lot of high bramble growth and bracken which took weeks to clear. As it’s too steep for tractors (Most of it is about 30’, with parts up to 45’) my wife and I did this ourselves using petrol strimmers. It took months of work to get it in a state good enough to call the fencers in, and they too struggled with the grade.",

    "content": "I’m a recent convert to Proxmox, the Virtualisation Environment. I’m running it on my homelab and find it excellent.\nAlthough Proxmox comes with its own backup system that is perfectly functional and reliably makes backups of my virtual machines on any schedule you like, I wanted to explore the free partner to it, Proxmox Backup Server And, having a new NAS that can run things on, I thought I’d try to get PBS running on there. Although I was already saving my backups to the NAS via a normal file share, it made sense to have PBS running directly on it rather than on the machine that might fail in the name of separation in case of hardware failure or disaster.\nThis is how I did it, and I’m very pleased I did. I now have enterprise level backups for my homelab at a grand cost of £0.00\nWhy not just continue to use Proxmox to save its own backups? Although Proxmox’s internal backups are good, they’re not particular smart. PBS has a number of advantages that make taking backups faster and quicker and allow things like instant file recovery without needing to recover the entire VM. Also, backups are fast and take up a lot less disk space.\nHere’s some key advantages of PBS Global Deduplication This is the single most significant advantage of PBS. Proxmox VE’s built-in backup creates a new, complete backup file for each job. PBS, on the other hand, performs global deduplication across all backups stored in a datastore. This means that if you have multiple virtual machines (VMs) or containers with the same operating system files, PBS only stores those identical data chunks once. This drastically reduces the amount of disk space required for your backups.\nIncremental Backups PBS uses a “forever-incremental” backup model. After the initial full backup, all subsequent backups only transfer and store the new or changed data blocks. This makes your daily backup jobs much faster and less resource-intensive, both on the source PVE host and on the network.\nData Integrity and Security PBS includes several features to ensure your backup data is safe and consistent.\nBuilt-in Checksums: It uses SHA-256 checksums to verify the integrity of every data chunk. This helps to detect silent data corruption, also known as “bit rot,” a major risk for long-term data storage.\nClient-Side Encryption: Data is encrypted on the source Proxmox VE host before it’s sent to the PBS, ensuring your data is secure during transit and at rest on the backup server.\nAdvanced Features and Management PBS provides a centralized, dedicated interface for managing all your backup jobs, with features that PVE’s basic backup utility lacks.\nFile-Level Restore: You can browse the contents of a backup and restore individual files directly from the PBS, without having to restore the entire VM.\nLive-Restore: This feature allows you to start a VM from a backup almost instantly. The VM can boot while the data is still being restored in the background, minimizing downtime.\nRemote Synchronization: PBS can synchronize datastores to a secondary, remote PBS instance, providing an easy and efficient way to create off-site backup copies for disaster recovery.Built-in Checksums: It uses SHA-256 checksums to verify the integrity of every data chunk.

The VM can boot while the data is still being restored in the background, minimizing downtime.\nRemote Synchronization: PBS can synchronize datastores to a secondary, remote PBS instance, providing an easy and efficient way to create off-site backup copies for disaster recovery.\nInstalling PBS If you’re not using a Ugreen NAS, most of these functions will also apply to any system that uses Docker compose\nCreate a new Shared Folder in the Files app for your Proxmox backups. This has to be large enough to hold your expected backups for obvious reasons. When you’ve created it, right-click the folder and copy down the location by clicking the copy symbol. We’ll need this later. Make a note of this Location\nStart by going to your Ugreen NAS and use the App Center to install Docker. This will create a new icon on your NAS’ desktop called Docker. When Docker is installed, open it.\nGo to Project and click Create Creating a new project for PBS\nName: Something like ‘proxmox-backup-server’\nStorage Path: This is where the Docker project stores its information for the container, not the where the backups are - but they can be the same if you wish.\nCompose Configuration: This is where you paste your docker-compose.yml file.\nThe docker-compose.yml file I used the image and compose file created by ayufan here\nThis is my version. There’s a few changes:\nWe need to replace the variables in the image. I replaced them with those given by ayufan elsewhere in his documentation The volumes are different, and start with a ./ to keep them relative to the above Storage Path I removed the separate Volumes below, and I added a new volume which connects the Shared Folder we created services: pbs: image: ayufan/proxmox-backup-server:latest container_name: proxmox_backup_server ports: - 8007:8007 volumes: - ./pbs_etc:/etc/proxmox-backup - ./pbs_logs:/var/log/proxmox-backup - ./pbs_lib:/var/lib/proxmox-backup - /volume1/pbs_backups:/pbs_backups restart: unless-stopped tmpfs: - /run stop_signal: SIGHUP cap_add: - SYS_RAWIO # smartctl support mem_limit: 2G When ready, go ahead and click Deploy. If all goes well, Docker will download the PBS image and create the container and launch PBS!\nWhen it completes, you’ll find it running in the Container tab in Docker’s menu.\nConfiguring Proxmox Backup Server PBS should now be available on port 8007 of your NAS’s ip. Go open it at https://IP_ADDRESS:8007\nThe initial credentials are: user admin@pbs and password pbspbs and chang the Realm to Proxmox Backup authentication Server\nOnce in PBS, the first thing you’ll want to do is add the storage to it.\nIn the PBS menu, select + Add Datastore Creating the datastore\nName: Something useful, but note that it will only accept certain characters.\nDatastore Type: Local (Because we’ve mounted the Location into the container as a volume)\nBacking Path: Enter in /pbs_backups or whatever name you used in the right-hand (local) side of the volume in your docker-compose.yml\nYou can also set the Global defaults for the Prune Options tab here, although you can change those later, or by job, if you wish.\nOnce you’re happy, click Add and PBS will connect to the Datastore and start creating its file structure.\nConnecting Proxmox to PBS The backup schedules and jobs are controlled, not on PBS, but on the Proxmox Server or Cluster itself, so we’ve some work to do there too.\nOpen up your Proxmox Server and visit Datacenter then Storage\nClick on Add and choose Proxmox Backup Server\nCreating a new PBS storage\nEnter in the details of your new PBS server something like this;\nConnecting PBS to Proxmox\nNote! The first time you connect, it will fail with an error about fingerprints;\ncreate storage failed: pbs_nas: error fetching datastores - fingerprint '8A:7B:19:A6:7C:2C:F4:BB:48:64:1B:3D:\u003credacted\u003e'' not verified, abort! (500) The fix for this is fairly straightforward. Copy the long STRING between the ’ quotes and paste it into the Fingerprints field, and retry. This time it should be happier, and the new storage will show up in Proxmox.\nScheduling a backup Once the storage is showing up, you can create a new Backup schedule\nDatacenter then Backup and Add Fill this up as you would for a normal backup job, but change Storage to your new pbs_nas storage (Or whatever you named it above).\nCreating a new backup schedule\nInfo: If you have an existing backup job, you can just change the Storage to this without recreating everything\nComplete your new schedule and test it by clicking Run Now with it selected.\nAll going well, Proxmox should connect to PBS and start the job. The first time will take around the same time as a normal Proxmox vm backup, but subsequent ones will be much faster as it will only copy the changes to each vm.\nAs well as seeing the backup job in Proxmox, it will also show up in PBS’s Dashboard - useful if you’re backing up from multiple sources.\nRestoring a backup This is done from your Proxmox server - in fact, you won’t need to revisit PBS again unless you need to change any settings as all management is done from Proxmox.\nIn the left menu, select your Proxmox Node and then your new pbs_nas Storage. Select Backups from there and you should see all the backups that now reside on your NAS. Note that as well as your usual Restore button, there is a File Restore button too. This allows you to download individual files from a backup nearly instantly. Restoring an individual file from a vm backup\nProblems If PBS isn’t working right, the first thing to do is to read the container logs. Do this by clicking on Docker -\u003e Container and proxmox_basic_server. Then click the Log tab.\nIf you get permission problems when PBS first tries to create chunks, then the Shared folder likely needs less restrictive permissions. This can’t be done through the web apps, only through the Docker container’s terminal.\nIn the Docker App, click the Container menu item, then the proxmox_backup_server entry and then the Terminal tab.\nIf prompted, create a new shell using /bin/bash/ (As it suggests)\nGive the backup directory full write permissions.\nchmod 777 /backups Stop the container (Basic Information tab, then the stop/start button) and then after a few seconds, start it again.",

I like to limit the CPUs and Ram, change the Container Name and enable Auto Restart\nWhen you’re happy, click Confirm and leave the tickbox ticked.\nCreating the container\nHopefully this will build your container, and pretty quickly it will be running.

    "content": "I have a UGREEN NASync DXP2800 NAS. It’s very good with some lovely design touches like the toolless caddies that are amongst the best I’ve ever used, including many enterprise systems.\nBut one thing annoys me, and others too, is that it has an inbuilt indexer and thumbnail generator for photos that runs on the files you upload, regardless of whether you want it to, or are even using the bundled Photo software or indexer. Some of use a NAS just to store files for other programs.\nThe problem with this is if your NAS uses hard drives, then it will cause a lot of activity going on for many hours or days after changes. This causes unneccessary wear on the drives and wastes power when they could have spun down, as well as being annoyingly noisy as the drives click and whirr for ages.\nThe indexer cannot be disabled through the otherwise very useful web interface, but can be disabled via ssh. Fortunately these Nas’s run Linux and the indexing service is a controlled by Systemctl, so can be turned off and disabled like any other linux service.\nCredit to /uZealousidealTax8340 for the original method.\nEnter the webui for your nas: IP-ADDRESS:9999 In Control Panel, under Connections \u0026 Access, select Terminal Tick Enable under SSH with a Shut Down automatically of something like 30 minutes. Click Apply. alt text\nNow connect to your NAS by SSH. This requires a SSH client like Putty (for Windows) or just “ssh” for linux.

Being more persistent If you want a more permanent solution, you can also automatically repeat this command every hour. Because this is a linux computer, it comes with cron, the scheduler.\nTo do this;\na) SSH into your nas as above. b) Become root (we need to run the command as the root user)\nsudo su - Enter your password\nc) crontab -e\nYou may be prompted to choose an editor, either nano or vi. nano is generally considered easier to use if you’re unfamiliar, choose whichever you like. If it doesn’t prompt, then it will use Vi\nd) Enter a new line containing this;\n0 * * * * systemctl disable --now index_serv thumb_serv This repeats the command at 0 minutes on every hour of every day\ne) Save and quit the editor.\nThis may still get overwritten by a firmware update of the NAS, in which case you’ll have to start over. Being even more persistent If that doesn’t work, then you can mask the services instead.\nsystemctl mask index_serv thumb_serv This tells systemd to symlink the service’s unit file to /dev/null and this makes it harder for it to be automatically re-enabled. An enable won’t work on a masked service.\nHowever, you can reverse this with systemctl unmask index_serv thumb_serv and you will then be allowed to enable and start the services again if you wish.",

Customers have reported an inability to download security patches, or even being unable to relicense at all. (And as Broadcom also cancelled Perpetual Licenses, this means that a lot of features companies rely upon stop working immediately) Atlassian, creators of Confluence, Jira and Trello cancelled self-hosting of their apps, forcing companies to migrate to their cloud products instead. (Not great for companies that prefer to keep their IP local) Paessler (Makers of enterprise monitoring and alerting platform, PRTG ) received significant investment by Turn/River, a venture capitalist firm. This resulted quickly with pricing rising 300 to 400% for existing customers. Venture Capitalist firms buying companies like Solarwinds, Splunk and many others causing concern amongst customers who expect much higher prices in the near future, worse support or reduced investment in development. Microsoft making a decision to require modern hardware for Windows 11, triggering the need to replace millions of perfectly good devices and generating a massive pile of e-waste. Companies using such software, and there can’t be many that haven’t been affected by these or similar changes recently, are faced with a tough decision - pay a lot more for the product or spend a lot of time and money transferring your operations to an alternative product.\n“Lock-in” was ever a cuss-word, but now it’s a major business risk that cannot be ignored.\nThe past is not the present Historically, business would choose commercial partners over FOSS products for two main reasons;\nSupport Whilst A) may seem like a very real and genuine concern - nobody wants to receive the phonecall at 3am to say their company’s entire infrastructure has crashed because of an obscure problem in one piece of software. When there’s no expert available to help you solve the problem, it makes for really difficult discussions with shareholders. Except that it’s very often no more of a concern than commercial software - Free Software doesn’t always mean a lack of support. And most definitely, free software is no more buggy than commercial software, and no less secure. That’s three things non-technical managers sometimes say, and three things thoroughly debunked over and again.\nSoftware like Zabbix, Proxmox, Gitlab, Docker, Nextcloud, Wordpress, MongoDb, MariaDb, Grafana, Mattermost, ElasticSearch are all free to use, even for Enterprise companies. Yet all have Enterprise companies attached that offer support contracts to ensure you still have someone to phone at 3am to hold your hand and help you put things back together. What’s more, they normally provide training, just like companies selling you commercial software. Yes - that has a financial cost, so whilst Free Software can be entirely free, extra services aren’t. That is the business model.\nStability This is no longer a reason to choose commercial software with companies being bought, asset stripped and customers milked like fat cattle. Large FOSS projects in 2025 are often very professional with rigorous release testing (something that Microsoft Windows patches in particular have struggled with, and Crowdstrike bringing down “a third of the internet” with a badly released update in July 19th, 2024 is forever etched in many sysadmin’s calendars).\nNo complicated licencing or concealed pricing Enterprise software rarely shows its price. It’s a shake-down - you’ve got to ask for a quote, and then wait whilst their agent researches your company to find out how much they can possible charge you. It costs the most they can get away with. Sure - that’s capitalism - but it leaves a nasty taste.\nDon’t waste time arguing with sales staff for licence renewals Your licence is expiring and suddenly you’re bombarded with your new best friend, the sales agent. The back and forth begins and takes a lot of your valuable time. The price has gone up - why? And why does it go down again if you threaten to leave, after often hours of negotiating.\nFOSS is better in every way So in short, Free Open Source Software is often:\nMore Secure\nHaving the source available for peer review is a proven benefit to security. Less unstable\nMajor projects are often more widely used than their commercial equivalents, so releases are tested on a far wider user base and hardware Cheaper\nAlthough the software is free, to be a fair comparison we need to include the cost of support if you’re unable to provide it in-house. That’s usually cheaper than the licence Time Saving\nWhilst you may still need to buy support contracts, they’re usually more transparently prices and take less back and forth arguing on pricing Less likely to change overnight\nInvestment capital firms and asset strippers are not interested in Software that can earn them no money. FOSS licensing would prevent them from making it closed source, and attempts to do so historically have led to the code being forked and a free alternative continued in some form. Additionally, they cannot stop your software working at the end of a contract in the way commercial licensing can. Business Continuity depends upon software doing the same tomorrow as it is doing today. …than it’s commercial counterparts.\nOf course, most companies can’t avoid using commercial software entirely. It’s required for some hardware systems, for cloud-based services, for compatibility with business partners and so on. But where there is a choice, perform due diligence and consider FOSS alternatives. Your IT budget will thank you for it. Your business stability will thank you for it.",

    "content": "A fun little project that has a useful function for me – wirelessly connecting a vehicle battery to Home Assistant.\nJustification: I wanted to be able to check my vehicle’s battery was good, and automatically alert me if it wasn’t.\nI own a classic Land Rover that doesn’t get driven enough, and I wanted to keep an eye on the battery voltage so that I knew when to put it on charge, using HA to alert me when it dropped below a certain point. That worked well for a while, but then I had much worse problems with my Motorbike which, despite two new batteries, went low enough to fail to start after only 10 days. I spent a long time trying to sort out the parasitic drain, but the general advice was “They all do that”. So I got a Optimate battery tender that trickle-charges it. The only problem was remembering to plug the thing in! So I moved my widget across to the bike shed and connected it directly to the 12v feed on the tender. Now, if I forget to plug it back in and the voltage drops below 12.6v, I get a SMS telling me I’ve been forgetful.\nThe Hardware: A nodemcu ESP8266 board circuit board (Other boards will work too) A power shield to step the incoming ~12v voltage down to a level that the ESP8266 can accept A car cigarette-lighter USB adapter (To stop the 12v down to ~5v and power the ESP8266) A box to keep it in (I used a standard UK wall-mount socket with blanking plate, but any box works as long as it provides some protection against knocks and the weather if it’s exposed to them. I’ve even used Chinese Takeaway containers) Super mega deluxe wireless voltage measuring device\nHere’s what it looks like: Wrapped in red tape – the 12-\u003e5v adapter Top left: The power shield to reduce 12v Bottom: The ESP8266, face down. Notes: If you’re running the ESP from a separate power supply, perhaps by measuring the voltage coming out of a trickle-charger instead of directly to the battery, you obviously won’t need any 12 -\u003e 5v adapter\nThe Ecosystem: Home Assistant Free open source Home Automation Platform, running in Docker on my home server EspHome Excellent plugin for Home Assistant that programs the 8266 board Grafana (Optional) Makes for prettier and more flexible graphs than Home Assistant does. Connecting them requires InfluxDb. Example setup guide ESPHome code: Esphome makes programming chips really as easy as it could be. I’ve always been interested in doing this, but had struggled with the thought of soldering and electronics generally. No need for any of that with this project.\nI installed esphome on a little low power PC that runs Debian and connected the ESP8266 via a usb lead. I then followed their instructions for creating a new project, and wrote the following code:\nesphome: name: voltage platform: ESP8266 board: nodemcu # Enable logging logger: # Enable Home Assistant API api: password: \"\" ota: password: \"\" wifi: ssid: \"WifiSSID\" password: \"WifiPass\" # Enable fallback hotspot (captive portal) in case wifi connection fails ap: ssid: \"Esphome Voltage Fallback Hotspot\" password: \"WifiPass\" captive_portal: #deep_sleep: # run_duration: 20s # sleep_duration: 10min sensor: - platform: adc pin: A0 name: \"Bike Voltage\" update_interval: 60s filters: - multiply: 24.8 Notes about the code: I first used this code on my Landrover, which took power from the main battery. The deep_sleep section puts the chip into a very low power state which saved a lot of drain. As my bike is connected to the output wires from a trickle charger, I commented out this section as I no longer need it. The multiply: value of 24.8 took quite a lot of trial and error to be accurate. I used a reliable multimeter on the same voltage source on my bench and then experimented with this until it matched. The power shield steps the voltage down to below the 3.3v that the chip can accept. If you connect 12v directly to the chip, it’s going to blow, so reducing it, reading it and then multiplying that value is the only way for this to work. Sounds quite hacky but it’s surprising how often solutions like this exist to get around such problems. This is then compiled by esphome and and uploaded to the chip via the usb lead and starts running.\nAny future updates to this code can be done without connecting it – esphome will connect to the device over the wifi connection and, by magic, update the code remotely!\nESPHome also runs as an integration in Home Assistant, and once installed, will automatically register new devices to itself.\nESPHome integration within Home Assistant\nThat entity this integration creates is then available within HA to do anything we want with. We can stick it on HA’s own dashboard like so\nHome Assistant Dashboard output\nAnd, by exporting it to Grafana, show prettier graphs of any range we like. In this one, we see the battery tender going through a cycle of topping up the battery, then sleeping for a bit, then repeating.\nGrafana chart, using Home Assistant as a data source\nI also have an Automation in Home Assistant that alerts me when the voltage drops below 12.2v, or stops updating for 24h as that means my bike is going to struggle to start and I’d rather find that out before I put on all my leathers and get ready to go out! The reason is usually because I’ve forgotten to plug it back into the charger!\nI hope you enjoyed this article and found it useful.",

It turned out to be surprisingly easy and in just an afternoon, things were up and working beautifully.\nThe WH1090 in-situ and working\nThe Physical Bits One Anenemeter, a HADEX WH1080. Although pretty much any pulse-based meter will work. It has two wires and putting a multimeter across them, I saw that one full revolution opens and closes these wires three times. Considering how fast these things can spin, that’s going to take a lot of counting! I extended the wiring by soldering and heat-shrinking a 5 meter length of bell wire onto it, then tested again. I mounted it on a shelf bracket with a suitable sized bolt that neatly screws into the mount, as i don’t have the full weather-station kit this unit comes with. This sits near my garage, although it’s not a great position since it’s quite sheltered. However, this is just a fun little project and I’m not too worried about its accuracy, and I won’t be sharing speeds with anyone else. One ESP8266 or ESP32 or similar chip. I’ve used a Nodemcu chip without any additional backboarding or hats. I put it in an old light-switch box just for some protection from knocks. Inside this scruffy thing lies the ESP8266, honest! Next time I’ll take better photos\nConnecting the bits The ESP8266 connects to HA by wifi, so it only needs a USB power supply and whatever connections we’re poking into it.\nThe Anenometer has two wires, and they open and close three times per revolution. It shouldn’t matter which way around they are connecting as we only care that they open and close.\nI connected these to pins GND and GPIO14 next to it (which is Pin D4 on the board) – see this useful reference for the NodemCPU to figure out which pins go where.\nThat’s it! One micro usb connector supplying 5v and two wires.\nThe ESPHome code (I won’t cover the ‘Getting started’ bit of ESPhome – they have their own excellent documentation here)\nBefore I placed the ESP8266 in position, I connected it to a small Linux PC via USB and did this;\nmkdir -p /opt/esphome/anenometer cd /opt/esphome/anenomter esphome wizard configuration anenometer.yaml This creates a directory for the files and changes into it, then sets up the initial yaml file for the project. Once you’ve answered some basic questions, you’re can then edit the anenometer.yaml file with the editor of your choice. (I use vi, but you do whatever you like)\nThis is what my anenometer.yaml file looks like once I’ve added in some bits\nesphome: name: anenometer platform: ESP8266 board: nodemcu # Enable logging logger: # Enable Home Assistant API api: password: \"\" ota: password: \"\" wifi: ssid: \"HOMESSID\" password: \"PASSWORD\" # Enable fallback hotspot (captive portal) in case wifi connection fails ap: ssid: \"Anenometer Fallback Hotspot\" password: \"PASSWORD\" captive_portal: sensor: - platform: pulse_meter pin: number: GPIO14 mode: INPUT_PULLUP name: 'Windspeed Meter' icon: 'mdi:weather-windy' id: wind_meter unit_of_measurement: 'mph' accuracy_decimals: 0 timeout: 5s filters: - multiply: 0.0015 - sliding_window_moving_average: window_size: 100 send_every: 100 Now, to explain some of the sensor bits here that might not be self-evident:\nName: What Home Assistant will call this entity. filters: multiply: This is where the trial and error comes in. At this stage, I’m guessing as I have no other point of reference, but this seems roughly to match the Beaufort Scale over the past few days. Do experiment with this value yourself. (The fact this is less than 1 means the multiplication is actually a division) sliding_window_moving_average: This allows us to count a bunch of pulses and then send a value every N number. Without this we would be trying to send every pulse, and as each rotate is three pulses, that might not be so good. window_size: How many pulses to read before establishing an average number over that time. This could be much larger to eliminate gusts, but it would be much slower to update in non-windy conditions. send_every: How many pulses are received before sending an update to HA. Again, Esphome has better and accurate documentation on each of these items here\nThat’s about it! The config was first uploaded to the ESP8266 using esphome run anenometer.yaml and then choosing the right-looking USB port.\nOnce it’s up though, you can change this file and update the ESP8266 over the air by re-running the same command and choosing “Over the air” instead of selecting a USB port. Magic!\nOne last thing! You’ll need to know what IP address your new ESP8266 was given. I find this out by checking my router’s DHCP list, but you can also use arpwatch to look for new devices.\nHome Assistant To add the new ESP8266 device to HA, we need to\nGo into Settings -\u003e Devices \u0026 Services in Home Assistant Click Add Integration Select ESPHome Enter the IP Address of your new ESP8266 (See ‘One Last Thing!’ above) and leave the default port of 6053 as it is. Click Submit. Your new device should appear in the ESPhome panel on the Integrations page, and selecting it will show it has one entity – which should be called Windspeed and have the entity id of sensor.windspeed_meter Clicking on that entry, and into the Info tab should show some data, and after a little while, look something like this My windspeed graph\nAnd that’s it! You can add it to any dashboards you like.",

Considering how fast these things can spin, that’s going to take a lot of counting! I extended the wiring by soldering and heat-shrinking a 5 meter length of bell wire onto it, then tested again. I mounted it on a shelf bracket with a suitable sized bolt that neatly screws into the mount, as i don’t have the full weather-station kit this unit comes with. This sits near my garage, although it’s not a great position since it’s quite sheltered. However, this is just a fun little project and I’m not too worried about its accuracy, and I won’t be sharing speeds with anyone else. One ESP8266 or ESP32 or similar chip. I’ve used a Nodemcu chip without any additional backboarding or hats. I put it in an old light-switch box just for some protection from knocks. Inside this scruffy thing lies the ESP8266, honest!

    "content": "The Aqara (and other) Zigbee devices are great in almost every situation. But when using them in cold conditions, such as inside a freezer, the default CR2032 batteries don’t last well, especially in subzero temperatures.\nFortunately, it’s really simple to adapt them to use the much larger and commonly available 18650 Lithium rechargable batteries. I’ve had several of these batteries reporting the temperature of my freezer in around -20c for over a year without needing recharging – quite remarkable!\nTo compare that to a CR2032, which would last just a couple of days for unbranded batteries, and even “Cold Formula” Ever-Ready batteries would give up the ghost between one week and two months, and you see why this is a modification that’s worth making, if just to avoid wasting lots of CR2032 and avoiding the environmental and safety costs associated.\nOne solution is simply to solder an 18650 battery holder onto the sensor itself. Both being single-cell lithium batteries, the voltages are identical at a nominal 3.2v but the capacity is dramatically different. The 18650 will often read up to 4.2v when freshly charged, but I’ve found no issues with connecting that directly to these sensors.\nThis isn’t restricted to Aqara or temperature sensors. Anything that takes a CR2032 or CR2016 or any other 3.2v lithium battery can usually be adapted this way.\nThings needed: A Zigbee/Zwave/whatever temperature/humidity/other sensor An 186550 single battery holder (Cost around £1-2, eg, ebay, aliexpress). You can solder directly to the battery if you prefer. A soldering iron and some solder. A hot glue gun (optional) or some tape/zip tie/whatever to hold the two things together. The wires and solder connections aren’t really strong enough to take any strain. Process (Difficulty: Simple) Take your sensor and uncover the battery compartment, removing the CR2032 battery.\nThe battery compartment of an Aqara Zigbee temperature sensor\nNote the two metal contacts. The little one at the top on the edge is the POSITIVE contact. The larger one in the middle is the NEGATIVE.\nIf you’re ever unsure about which way these go, use a multi-meter to test the CR2032 battery. The larger surface on these is positive and often marked with a + sign. The smaller, back face is negative.\nNow check the battery holder and if necessary strip around 5mm of plastic back from the ends of the red and black wires;\nExcuse the shadows – there are only two wires here!\nNext, solder the black wire from the battery holder onto the middle contact, and the red to the edge contact.\nIt should look something like this, but perhaps with neater soldering!\nThat’s all there is to the electric connections, and now is a good change to test it still works\nFit a battery to the holder and quickly press the button on the sensor. This should result in a blue light. If it doesn’t, or you small a burning electrical smell, remove the battery quickly and check which way you’ve connected the wires. (I’ve done this myself and surprisingly the sensors seem to survive mis-polarity for a short interval)\nIf things look good, you can then try a longer press and hold to ensure it connects to your zigbee network.\nThis is what Zigbee2Mqtt looks like when a device is registering to its network, only slightly less fuzzy.\nIf everything is good, then it’s time to glue or tape the battery holder and sensor together. I love hot glue, it’s messy and hurts when it gets on your skin, but very useful for stuff like this.\nThey are glued together, honest\nPlease excuse the tape-residue on the sensor\nBecause I’m placing these in a freezer, I like to put them in a small ziplock bag to protect them a little from frost condensation. This may not be strictly necessary – these small devices are remarkably robust – but it doesn’t hurt.\nThe sensor should keep on checking in from now on until the battery finally needs recharging\nOne of my freezer sensors showing the fluctuation as the freezer’s own thermostat runs on and off through the day\nNow you’ve done that, you might want to create an Automation in your Home Assistant or other monitoring program that lets you know when the temperature raises above a certain temperature, say -5c.\nAutomations like this have notified me when someone’s left the freezer door open, or it’s been unplugged by accident, and even after several hours of a power cut.\nNotes Freezer doors are usually made of steel and of course, this does affect the radio signal of Zigbee. However, in practice, I’ve found that the signal still gets through in my environment. Zigbee does benefit from a few mains-powered devices dotted through the home which add as mesh repeaters and perhaps that’s helped me out. Alternatively When I first did this, I placed the battery outside of the freezer to keep it warm, and ran the thin wires through the door seal. That worked okay, but out of curiousity I tried putting the whole thing inside and found that surprisingly, the battery lasted almost as long as being left outside in the warm. You could even use an external 3v power supply.\nYou can use other types of temperature sensors. I’ve used both one-wire DS18B20 temperature sensors and DHT11/22’s by pushing the wire through the door seal.",

Through the summer, a typical sunny day charges the 5.4kwh battery by about 11 AM, then heats the water and exports to the grid for another few hours before the hot water’s heated. For our house of two, that meant the LPG boiler that normally heats the water stayed off through all of July and August, and most of June and September. Not bad for an investment of £85\nBackground I had Solar panels fitted a month ago. At the time I discussed with the engineer about using excess to heat water, directly from the inverter. But there was no immersion heater fitted to my tank at that time, and the installer wasn’t keen on adding that to the job.(And having fitted it myself now, I totally understand why, fitting the element was a tank-out pig of a job that took most of a day)\nBut once the solar panels were fitted and generating power, I wasn’t entirely happy to see the excess being pushed back into the grid for nothing. (After much setting up and back and forth, I did start to be paid 5p per kwh, but as I pay them 33p for the same, I don’t consider this a great deal)\nAnyway, I scratched my head and came up with this system.\nItems: The Inverter and Battery and GivEnergy systems are integrated into my HA setup thanks to cdpuk’s integration 11, which works perfectly. This allows me to get all the stats I need into HA, and display them like this: Solar Inverter integrating into Home Assistant\nA low power 1kw 27″ top-mounted immersion element. Normal immersions are 3kw, which is more than I can generate to excess. 1kw is perfect for me. I fitted this to the tank (fiddly) and connected it to a 13a capable flex which connected to a standard UK 13a fused plug. Top of the 1kw immersion element, showing its two thermostats (one user settable, one factory set)\nA TPLink MiniKasa smart socket. (wifi) The socket is rated for 13a and by choosing a low power immersion (they’re normally 3kw for fixed wiring) I’m keeping load on that around 5a at 230vac, and the switch is not getting warm. I would be more concerned about load with an unbranded or low quality switch. But even in a warm room, this is fine. TPLink MiniKasa socket that allows HA to turn the Immersion Element on and off\nA Onewire temperature sensor on the outside of the hot water tank. Have also used Aqara sensors for this. On the picture above, that’s the “HW_Tank” reading on the above screenshot.\nAn existing Home Assistant setup.\nCost: £73 for the 1kw element. £12 for the MiniKasa smart socket £5 for ancillaries (socket, wiring, sensor, tea) £7,700 for the solar install (ahem) Controlling things This just needs two very simple automations\nIf the solar system is sending \u003e1200 watts to the grid for more than 5 minutes and the temperature of the tank is \u003c60c:\nTurn on socket feeding the immersion. If sending \u003c1000w to the grid for more than 3 minutes or temp \u003e65c:\nTurn off socket feeding the immersion. Safety: Some things to consider if you fancy doing something similar.\nThis is a traditional UK Y-Plan vented hot water system. It’s fed by an unpressurised cold water tank in the loft, so there is little risk of explosion should the water get too hot.\nMy tank didn’t have space to insert the heating element in-situ, so I needed to drain and remove it. Even then, the top nut was very stiff and difficult to remove.\nBe competent at mains wiring.\nChoose an immersion element with dual thermostats. One of these should be set by the factory, the second is where you set the target temperature. Once either is reached, it will cut power into the element regardless of the switch. This system is independent of HA and any automation - that’s important.\nBuild in as many safeguards as you can. For example, I have a tertiary automation that turns off the switch if it happens to be on at sunset, when there’s no chance of any more free power. This is a safety precaution, but also a cost one. Electricity from the mains is expensive - I don’t want that to be heating my water by accident!\nIt’s working great. The water gets hotter\nResult It’s working great. The system satisfies my house hot water needs entirely on any sunny day (in Winter too). My LPG boiler doesn’t get used in the summer, although it’s still connected and will step in if the water drops too low during its own schedule.\nIt’s hard to estimate the cost saving, but it certainly repays the investment several times a year. (That’s this project, not the whole solar install!)",

There’s several ways to use them and I’ll explain a couple.\nOne wire with Home Assistant (ESPHome and ESP32/ESP8266 controllers, or USB) This is my absolute favourite way of using these sensors nowadays. I find working with ESPHome a pleasure and the wiring is very simple and forgiving. There are various forms of connectors\nThis guide assumes you have set up ESPHome already and have a microcontroller ready to be written\nStep 1 - The physical wiring. There are two main type of 1-wire temp sensors:\nThe DS1820 or DS18S20 bare sensor The DS18B20 or Waterproof Most people will buy the DS18B20 which is easier to assemble and still very cheap.\nConnections: Red wire of DS18B20, Pin 3 (VDD) of DS1820 should be connected to between 3 and 5v. Both these voltages are typically available on an ESP, but 3.3 is the more commonly used. Black wire of DS18B20, Pin 1 (GND) of DS1820 1 should be connected to GND on the ESP. Yellow wire of DS18B20, Pin 2 (DQ) of DS1820, should be connected to the GPIO port you choose on your ESP. The Resistor A resistor should be placed between the Red and Yellow (Pins 1 and 3 on the DS1820) to “Pull up” the bus. This should be 4.7k ohms. However, I have tested with various resistors down to 1kohm, and even omitted it entirely and had satisfactory results. But it does seem to work best with 4.7kohms used. The resistor should be connected as close to the ESP as possible, so it affects the whole bus.

This is simply done by creating either a single “star” where multiple sensors are fed from the same connections, or from multiple stars where connections are made from a common backbone wire. In all cases, it is simply a case of connecting all the same wires or pins together. Every red to a red, every black to a black, every yellow to a yellow - until the first connection which goes to the relevant pins on the ESP.\nDiagram of a multi-star one-wire bus\nNotes: Either sensor can run at between 3 and 5v dc and the red/pin3 can be connected to either. It does not affect accuracy which is used. Sensors have a unique ID which is reported along with their readings along the common “bus” back to the ESP or controller. This ID is how we identify which device is supplying which reading. It is possible to run large lengths of one-wire with many devices. I personally have run a bus of around 80 feet with 12 sensors connected to it. One wire can be remarkably resilient on the type of wire it uses. There are recorded cases if people using house pipework. It’s reported that longer installations work best with an external 5v power supply, but I have had no problem using an ESP’s 3.3v output. The current needed is tiny. Although it’s called one wire, a good installation requires three cores. That said, it is possible to create a network by connecting only two cores. This is done by connecting the red and yellow wires of the DS18B20 (The outer two, GND and VDD of a DS1820). This can work very reliably and avoids the needs of a resistor, but should only be considered if three core wire is unavailable. Step 2 - Ok, so the wiring’s done, what about taking readings? There are multiple ways to get the readings into Home Assistant.\nESPHome Assuming you already have an ESP set up and ready to use.\nConnect the wiring as above to the ESP (Most GPIO pins can be used for the Signal/DQ/Yellow pin - we’ll use GPIO5 for our example below (Pin D1 on a Nodemcu)\nAdd this to the ESPHome yaml;\n# GPIO one_wire: - platform: gpio pin: GPIO5 And run esphome run MyESPFile.yaml and wait until it boots and starts producing logs.\nInside the logs, assuming the physical connection is good, ESPHome will discover all devices on the one-wire bus, like so:\n[20:59:28][C][gpio.one_wire:022]: GPIO 1-wire bus: [20:59:28][C][gpio.one_wire:023]: Pin: GPIO14 [20:59:28][C][gpio.one_wire:084]: Found devices: [20:59:28][C][gpio.one_wire:086]: 0x9c01145eeabd4028 (DS18B20) [20:59:28][C][gpio.one_wire:086]: 0xee012026de4a2428 (DS18B20) [20:59:28][C][gpio.one_wire:086]: 0x0401202706051528 (DS18B20) [20:59:28][C][captive_portal:089]: Captive Portal: These provide the unique ID of each temperature sensor and the model needed.\nNow you have the information you need to re-edit the yaml and create the sensors properly, like so:\nsensor: # Dallas # Repeat for each sensor on this bus - platform: dallas_temp address: 0x9c01145eeabd4028 name: \"Boiler Flow\" update_interval: 30s - platform: dallas_temp address: 0xee012026de4a2428 name: \"Hot Water Tank\" update_interval: 30s Tips The DB18B20 sensor may have the ID printed on its label and you can create the sensor config on your first go.\nIf your Dallas bus has several sensors and you’re unsure which sensor relates to which purpose, continue streaming logs after building it, and simply hold one in your hand (or mouth, or cup of ice) for a little while until its readings change. Then add a sticky label to its lead.\nConnecting the Onewire bus to a PC (Not for ESPHome) You will need an adapter to connect your one-wire bus to your PC, such as the DS9490R\nThis can be connected to Home Assistant directly using it’s native 1-wire integration or, as I did (because the former wasn’t available when I first set up one-wire), by using Linux’s OWFS one-wire file system, and writing a script to read the values from the local file system and put them into a MariaDb database, from which HA would fetch the values. (Not a very elegant way, but it worked well for years!)",

That wide bit acts like a natural hinge and despite the plastic being reasonably thick, I could move the top of the screen back with my finger and very little pressure about an inch.\nProblem 2 So I hopped on and put the bike on full lock as I turned to leave my home. The mirrors hit the screen! I will admit that my left mirror is on an extension bar, but the right hand mirror is entirely stock. BOTH mirrors hit the screen at full lock. This is terrible! Not only does it risk damaging the screen. Not only did it push one mirror back out of alignment. But it’s also dangerous for it to interfere with the steering. That’s a part of the MOT check for British bikes so it could actually fail a safety inspection.\nMy cockpit\nProblem 3 I’m 6’2″ tall, so I expected some buffetting on the stock screen. Somehow, this taller screen actually made that worse! It redirected air that was previously hitting me in the chest and pointed it right at my head, increasing buffetting. It actually lowered the speed where I closed my visor from around 40mph to 30mph, and I didn’t need any lunch after an hour’s riding because I’d eaten so many flies!\nSo, in all, a very disappointing purchase.

    "content": "The TV Program, Long Way Round was what made me want a motorbike, and specifically a BMW GS. In my mid 40s and facing a mid life crisis, I decided to do bikes. I wanted to travel the world too. It looked cool, it looked fun, it looked interesting.\nSo I did my CBT (Uk basic test), bought a £300 Chinese 125 and rode through the winter to get some miles in. Then booked the DAS test (same as the EU bike test – it’s tough) and then went to a bike showroom and ended up buying a high-mileage 2004 BMW R1200GS with full luggage – even before I passed my test. Luckily I did pass and loved riding it.\nBut as I grew in experience, I began to think that it might not be the bike for me.\nIt was complicated. First the ABS pump died, and there’s lots of horror stories about that with the early BMWs. It knocked my confidence back a bit (as it died it fought back, releasing brakes at the wrong time, and pulsing heavily on corners. ) I had the ABS bypassed by a mechanic, and the brakes were brilliant after that. But I lived in fear of further problems. Clutch slipping? Oh no, that needs the bike splitting in half to replace! Rear bearing feel a bit sloppy? That needs a week in the workshop too. The alternator did seize, and I managed to replace that myself quite cheaply, but it was a big thing for me to do – I’m no mechanic.\nMy 2004 BMW R1200 GS\nBut the main problem I had was – it’s too damned big and too damned heavy. I lived in fear of riding down a narrow lane and meeting a tractor. Trying to turn that lump around by myself downhill gave me sleepless nights. (Don’t tell me I could just spin the back wheel or pivot on the side-stand, I’m not that good a rider and these lanes have grass in the middle)\nThen I saw the Royal Enfield Himalayan and loved its looks. I went to the local dealer and did a test ride. It was everything the GS was not – light (it’s not actually that light, but by comparison), very nimble and flickable, and is superb off road even on the stock tyres. Turning into my road there’s a patch of gravel that always made the GS slide the front wheel and tighten my sphincter. The Himmie doesn’t even notice it. I found myself driving up the middle bit of the lanes, full of mud and stones.The Enfield finds grip EVERYWHERE. So I rode back to the dealer and said \" “When can I have one?” \" “Three days if you pick a colour we’ve got in stock”. \" “Good, let’s do that then.”\nI’ve owned the Himalayan for a little over three months. I’ve put a thousand miles on it – the average annual mileage I put on the GS in the past four years. I did the first service, I adjusted the valves. I enjoy maintaining it, working on it. It’s simple honest engineering that’s designed to do a job.\nI’m now searching out green lanes and exploring my local county as much as I can, really enjoying the simple pleasure of just riding along roads without a destination in mind. \" “Oh, that looks like an interesting road, let’s go there”\nSo the GS goes on eBay and I’ve just loaded it into a van to go to its next owner. I hope they enjoy it, it really is a nice bike. On the motorway it’s excellent, and the power for overtaking is superb. But I’ve often felt like I had to apologise to it for not being a better rider. I’ve been scared of it several times, I’ve never even pinned the throttle back all the way, and been startled by corners coming up way faster than I expected. I never once went off road because I think that to handle that much weight and power away from the tarmac, you need to be a very good rider.\nThere’s little comparison between the two bikes. The Himalayan is a little tractor that will go absolutely anywhere, and it gives back a huge amount of confidence to the rider.\nThe GS is a big, powerful German who wants to run up every hill and is disappointed if you don’t want to just nip across two countries and be back in time for tea. The Himalayan is a big friendly dog that is your best childhood friend and wants to do whatever you want to. It doesn’t judge you and it doesn’t feel bad if you just want to ride at 20mph along Devon lanes for an hour or two.\nFor me, the joy of riding is about the ride. It’s not about getting somewhere, so who cares if it’s slower? More time to look and and appreciate the countryside.\nThe Himalayan (in front of the smaller peaks of Haytor)\nUpdate, November 2023:\nEight months of owning the Himalayan, and I’ve put 3,000 miles on it – more than I put on the GS in four years of ownership. And those are not motorway miles – the Himalayan is no trans-continental autobahn beast, it’s a plodder. Most of those miles are done at 20-40mph in narrow lanes as I explore my county of Devon. I’ve even done quite a few green lanes by myself, and joined the TRF to learn more about trials riding. (And learned that a Himalayan is not quite the tool of choice!) It suits me and I still like it a lot.\nI’ve done the first service, including valve checks. It’s a very easy bike to work on and quite simple. It’s well made – all bolts are stainless steel, the frame’s strong. Maybe the engine light has a tendency to come on at the slightest excuse but you can generally ignore it if the bike sounds ok, and it’ll turn itself back off again after a while.\nThe new Himalayan 452 has been launched elsewhere, and it’s an interesting bike. I can certainly see why many people are interested in the increase of power. But I’m going to stick with my 411 and it’s 24.5 hp for a while longer, I think.\n** Update, June 2025**\nThe Himalayan is up to 7,000 miles now and I still love it. It’s a well built and reliable machine.\nProblems I have had:\nRoyal Enfield Battery died. I’d had a lot of low voltage warnings and after 3 starts during a service, it refused to crank. I replaced with a cheap SLA 12AH battery costing £29 and have not had another warning light since. (I do keep it on a battery tender when not in use, which does help) Wouldn’t start after I’d been fitting a pair of dashcams. Turns out I’d pulled a wire out of the fuel pump connector through being heavy handed. 100% my fault and I managed to repair it. A puncture on the first ride after I’d replaced the rear tyre myself. Yep - my fault again. I’d pinched the inner tube! Conclusion: Royal Enfield make good bikes that are reliable and affordable.",
    "description": "The TV Program, Long Way Round was what made me want a motorbike, and specifically a BMW GS. In my mid 40s and facing a mid life crisis, I decided to do bikes. I wanted to travel the world too. It looked cool, it looked fun, it looked interesting.\nSo I did my CBT (Uk basic test), bought a £300 Chinese 125 and rode through the winter to get some miles in. Then booked the DAS test (same as the EU bike test – it’s tough) and then went to a bike showroom and ended up buying a high-mileage 2004 BMW R1200GS with full luggage – even before I passed my test. Luckily I did pass and loved riding it.",

    "content": "A 16t sprocket suitable for Himalayan and Scram motorbikes\nThe Reasoning One of the most popular modifications for the Royal Enfield Himalayan is to replace the front drive sprocket which changes the gearing through all gears.\nThe stock Himalayan is fitted with a 15-tooth (15t) front sprocket which takes drive from the engine onto the chain. This provides reasonable gearing for the 24.5bhp for a wide variety of riding surfaces, but as the bike only has five gears, this means that top-end speed is undergeared, and to achieve motorway/highway speeds you must push the engine into the 5k to 6k range (70mph indicated = 5800rpm for my tests on stock tyres, level road). As the engine redlines at a low 6000 this means a lot of noise, vibration and engine wear to keep up with traffic.\nFor only £17 and an hour’s time, I was able to change this sprocket to a 16-tooth one which has resulted in a much nicer highway experience, and as I spend most of my time riding on tarmac, this was a good solution for me.\nShould you do this? If you do a lot of road riding, particularly above 50mph, I would say yes, definitely. If you mostly ride on dirt, or narrow tracks, best to keep it as it was designed.\nThe Process Parts: 1x Front Sprocket: 16-tooth (16t) 525 Pitch. Item part: 29055 16s I bought mine here for £16.63 and it arrived in two days. It appears to be a common part between many Royal Enfield bikes, and this one was advertised for the Interceptor. It’s made by the German company ESJOT and is good quality. I think it will last just as long as the original. (Disclaimer: I receive no benefit from either company mentioned. I paid for the part as a regular customer and have no ongoing relationship with them.) Tools A metric socket set. I also found a breaker bar useful to loosen the main sprocket nut. 12mm spanner to loose chain adjusters. (There’s one in the bike’s toolkit) A hammer and screwdriver or punch to flatten the soft metal locking tab, and reset it afterwards. Process I’ll describe it here, and there are good guides by other people if you need on Youtube: by Unfastened :: By Two Wheels Ben\nNote: At 1500 miles, my bike’s original chain was sufficiently run-in that the original chain worked fine. Others have reported that you may need an extra link, or 112-link chain. I would suggest trying this anyway, reverting it is easy enough if you find you do need a longer chain, and you won’t be left without a bike. You don’t need to remove or split the chain to replace this sprocket, although if you’re doing both sprockets you may find it easier, especially if also replacing the chain.\nHow I did it:\nPut bike on centre stand\nLoosen main rear wheel bolt, and loosen both 12mm lock nuts to adjust the chain. Slacken the chain fully and push the rear wheel forwards to give the chain as much slack as you can.\nRemove the two 8mm bolts on the sprocket cover (Front of chain) and remove cover.\nUsing a punch or screwdriver, flatten the soft and shiny washer behind the main nut – it will have a tab folded over to stop the main nut undoing. Just unfold it enough so the nut will turn.\nUsing the correct socket, undo the main nut. (It’s a normal right-hand thread)\nHint: To stop the wheel turning, I went to the other side of the bike and pushed down the rear brake with my foot. Then, leaning over the bike, I used an extension bar to gain the leverage to undo the nut. It’s on tight!\nRemove the nut and soft washer, noting which way they’re facing.\nNow remove the old sprocket. This is most easily done by sliding it out with the chain still around it. It should come off fairly easily as you’ve slackened the chain. Once off the bolt, you can unroll it from the chain.\nCompare the old and new sprockets. The new one should be similar and fit the chain well. The writing should face towards you to help identify it once fitted, but the sprocket appears to be bi-directional. The original sprocket has a bonded plastic facing, which I think is for noise deadening, so they won’t look that similar – but it doesn’t make any difference to the fitting.\nFit the new sprocket into the chain and fit it over the drive bolt. This will probably be a snug fit, and you may need to use something to lever against the frame to persuade it home (don’t use anything metal or you may damage the frame and sprocket)\nOnce located, rotate the wheel to ensure the chain is well seated and turns freely, and that there is adequate slack.\nRefit the shiny washer in the same direction it came off, and refit the nut. Tighten the nut well.\nUsing a screwdriver, bend the shiny washer up to stop the nut undoing – making it as it was before you began.\nRefit the sprocket cover with the two 8mm bolts. Warning: Soft bolts, do not overtighten!\nTighten the chain to normal levels, and secure the locking nuts and main wheel bolt.\nHave a cup of tea.\nThe Results Normal Riding\nNot a huge amount of difference to be felt, it’s only a 7% or so ratio difference after all. I found it felt more like a normal road focused motorbike. Gear changes feel the same, no more or less vibration. The only thing I found was that I was more likely to bog the bike at low revs as I’d gotten used to changing up earlier. After just half an hour of riding, I’d got used to it though.\nNarrow lanes\nI live on Dartmoor on the UK and we have a lot of very bendy, narrow (less than 3m) tarmac roads set deep within high banks. Typical speed on these is around 20mph as visibility is low. Before, I was riding these in 2nd or 3rd and after fitting the sprocket, more often in 2nd but almost as often in 3rd, and keeping the same speed. No big difference here.\nFaster single carriageway roads (A and B classification)\nMore noticable here, the Himalayan feels more normally geared. Progress is better, and overall slightly faster. There’s more of a speed difference between gear changes, perhaps I was holding on for another 5 or 10mph before changing up to 3rd or 4th. Before changing the sprocket, I would often ride these in 5th, but after I was more often in 4th, only changing up when I got about 45mph or higher. Before, I could easily leave it in 5th from 30mph onwards if riding lazily.\nMotorway / Highway (70mph legal limit, riding at 55+)\nThis is where the modification really pays off and you will feel its benefits.\nEarlier this week, I’d ridden back from Cornwall, which included a 90 minute stretch of the A30 which was running clear. At 60mph, there was noticeable noise and vibration and mechanical sympathy stopped me going to 70mph for more than brief overtaking spells. Even that relatively brief time left me with mild tinnitus, despite wearing earplugs and using the stock exhaust.\nA test ride on the motorway after fitting this was much more relaxed, able to comfortably cruise at 65-70 with some power left in reserve for overtakes and hills, although steep hills will undoubtedly require a visit to 4th gear. I’m 6’2″ and 110kg, so it can support larger riders at this speed too. Whilst the Himalayan could do these speeds with a 15t as well, it ran out of RPMs way before it ran out of power. The bike itself is stable and comfortable at 70mph on a non-windy day.\nHere’s the actual figures as I recall them.\nNote: The Himalayan speedometer over-reads by around 5% (confirmed by GPS), and these speeds are from that, so actuals will be slightly lower. However, they are consistent enough for useful comparison.\nMPH RPM with 15t Sprocket RPM with 16t Sprocket 50 4500 4100 60 5000 4400 70 5800 5000 Pros and Cons Pros\nQuieter, less vibration. Overall more comfortable cruising. More able to comfortably stay at 70mph. Less engine wear Better fuel economy Easily reversed. Cheap and immediately effective. Cons\nA taller first gear, losing some of the Himalayan’s tractor-like crawling ability at slow speeds. The original lower gearing may be preferred by those who do mostly off-road, trail or mountainous riding, plus those who ride in cities as a commuter or who carry heavy loads. Conclusion Like every modification one does to a vehicle, it’s a compromise that won’t suit every use-case. Motorbike manufacturers spent a lot of time and effort making the best bike they can for the money and original equipment is often the best for most riders. But things like gearing are a compromise, and this is especially true where we riders choose to use a bike designed for climbing mountains as a daily runabout on flat 70mph tarmac, so where we can adapt it to better suit our specific needs, it can be good to do so.\nFor under £20 and an hour’s time, you can easily improve your Himalayan’s on-road performance. It’s not surprising that this is one of the most common modifications that Himalayan owners perform. Even if a new chain was required, I think the cost is easily justified if you do any amount of highway work.\nIf you are not mechanically inclined, then any workshop will be able to do this for you if you supply them with the new sprocket.",

    "content": "Grips fitted. Note oxford control box on left\nI’m a huge fan of heated grips, having discovered them on my GS. When I was learning to ride a bike, I rode through the winter on a Sinnis Cafe 125 and often got so cold I’d have to pull over and warm my hands on the engine – sometimes every 2 or 3 miles. My circulation isn’t the best thanks to beta blockers, and that also means I get vibration numbness fairly quickly when it’s cold – so I pretty much consider grips a necessity for riding in the UK 3/4 of the year.\nOxford are a well known manufacturer of self-install grips, and as my new Himalayan came without such pleasures, I bought a set of their Adventure grips for £60 in 2023 and installed them.\nI bought these with my own money and I receive no benefit for this review, nor am I linked to the manufacturer in any way. This is my honest opinion.\nSo, what’s the verdict? Overall: 9.5/10\nVery good. Strongly recommended if you ride anywhere even slightly cold.\nValue: 8/10\n£59.99 (UK, Q1 2023) for well made, robust and weatherproof grips and controller seems like a very good price to me, and that’s someone who is not afraid to scour the internet to buy cheap. I bought these from Amazon.\nQuality: 9/10\nGood to very good. The grips are a little softer than the Himalayan’s original ones, which is fine – although I imagine they will wear through within several years. They’re very grippy as a result, which is good, and you don’t need to hold them as tight.\nThe controller is well sealed, very clear to use (pic above, it’s the box marked ‘Oxford’) and very simple to operate with one thumb without taking your eyes off the road. At the time of writing we’re close to Winter and I’m using them most trips.\nHeat: 9/10\nThey’re not immediately hot, taking perhaps 2-3 minutes to warm up enough to feel through your gloves. But once up, they keep the set temperature very smoothly and I could detect no “modulation” where they get alternatingly hot and cold. The 5 settings are well spaced and I tend to use the 40%, 50% and 75% settings most. 100% is too hot for anything above sub zero temperatures, but it’s good to know it’s there if you need it.\nInstructions: 7/10\nFairly typical “Few sheets of paper” installation instructions. Perhaps a little light if you’re unfamiliar with electrics or working on your bike, and you might want to seek some help. I do know people who have paid mechanics to fit these and that’s definitely an option.\nI did disagree quite strongly with the instructions on one item, which is that they tell you to connect these straight to the battery (they include an inline fuse). This means you need to turn them off manually every time you stop, or they’ll stay on. This obviously uses the battery power and I believe will cause you starting problems if you do leave them on, especially in cold weather. As a protection, they say these will automatically turn off when the voltage drops to 11.5v, but I think that’s far too low and some bikes will struggle to start at that voltage. I used a switched-live relay to fit mine, which turns them off with the bike. That means you need to remember to turn them back on again, but auto-off is a small price to pay to be able to start your bike! I’ll detail that further below.\nFitting: 9/10\nThe whole fitting process took me a couple of easy hours with a couple of stops for tea and pondering. It’s well within the capabilities of most people, but if you’re unsure, stop and research before continuing.\n**Step 1: Removing the stock grips. **\nI slit mine open with a sharp knife – they’re glued, so sliding them off didn’t work, but if you’re more patient you may succeed where I failed.\n*Step 2: Fitting the new grips.\nEnsuring you use the R and L grips appropriately, fit and glue them in place. I used superglue which has held up well. Note: Be careful how you position the throttle side cable. I know someone who broke down because his glue failed and the grip slowly rotated until each time he let go of the throttle, the cable pressed against the bike’s kill switch which, as you can see in the top photo, is very easily crossed by the cable. His bike then stopped and it took a while for him to figure out why… The positioning in my photo has worked well for me but you should experiment to find what’s best for you and your bike.\n**Step 3: Fitting the controller. **\nI put mine on the left hand side where I can use my left thumb, but positioning is entirely personal. You may need a little fettling to expand the supplied bracket’s holes as I did, which I’ve protected with a clumsy blob of paint as in this picture:\nRear of Control box - ignore my sloppy black paint\nStep 4: The wiring.\nEach grip connects to the controller with a nicely sealed plug and socket, and can be tidied away with zip ties, ensuring you have enough flex to turn the bars without straining anything. Then there’s just one cable to connect to your power source or relay.\nWhere to connect to the power: I strongly, STRONGLY, recommend using a fused, switched live to power these grips.\nTip: Since I fitted mine, I’ve heard of a chap who took a supply from the horn feed, which he says is switched live and fused. (I have not verified this) That would certainly be easier than my method if so, and worth you checking. It also saves a good bit of cable tidying as it’s at the right end of the bike.\nI ran the cable under the tank back to the battery area under the seat. This is what it looks like after connecting things.\nUnder seat cabling\nYou can see the shiny black cable with the in-line fuse carrier on its side coming in from the left (front). That’s going to the Oxford controller.\nThe red wire connects from a switched live I found in the small, black six-way connector that’s there, at least in 2023 Himalayans. I probed around with a multimeter until I found a switched live, then pushed the single wire in there (with a crimped connector), and folded it back, holding it in place with some black insulation tape. I did that rather than break into wiring so that I could remove this later if needed.\nThe other end of the red wire goes into that piece of bicycle inner tube which is protecting a standard automative relay and connects the battery positive to the Oxford feed wire.\nFor those unfamiliar with relays; A relay is simply a switch for a power feed that is controlled by a second feed. This allows high-power devices to be controlled by much smaller capacity switches. They’re widely used on all vehicles to simplify wiring. A starter solenoid is an example of a relay that prevents a very thick wire having to be run up to a very large switch controlled by a key – the key sends a small current to the solenoid which has a thick wire from the battery and allows current to flow to the starter.\nThis setup has worked well for me for a couple of thousand miles and should last indefinitely, but there are many ways to connect such things.\nTime for a brew somewhere pretty",

They’re easy to fit, too!\nBackstory I like to carry a few things when I’m riding. Tools, a can of tyre weld, a spare litre of fuel, a couple of cereal bars and, being English, a flask of tea. So luggage was always something I needed. However, the official RE Panniers are surprisingly expensive, so originally I fitted two £10 military surplus kit bags like so:\nHimalayan with kit bags\nThese worked really well, quite roomy, no rattles and did well through the summer. But come the winter, the muck thrown up by the road made them very dirty and the contents wet, even when wrapped in plastic bags. They certainly weren’t unusable, but I fancied something else. 50cal ammo boxes are cheap and a good size, so I bought five for £30 off ebay, delivered. Good deal.\nFitting Ammo Cans WARNING! This was written BEFORE ONE OF THE CANS FELL OFF! The Ebay purchased mounts shown here were sub-standard. Not only did they rust through on the lower support arms on both sides, which failed after a few months (the metal is really thing) but one day the top weld snapped and the entire can… disappeared, along with contents.\nFirst – I removed the old bags. I’ll use them again later for something, they are very useful and quite tough. That left the pannier mounts, which cost something like £24 – the European models don’t come with them fitted, nor with a Sari guard which is standard for the Indian market.\nI initially used the two centre bolts on these mounts drilled through into the ammo can. That worked\nNext, I put some self-adhesive foam onto the frame. Not strictly necessary, but I thought it might help prevent rattling\nAnd then positioned the cans\nAnd drilled a couple of holes and painted them badly\nThe bit of butyl rubber here is to cover a larger hole on the left hand side box so that I can still reach the keyhole for the seat\nThen bolted in tight. I positioned them so the hinges face forwards – just seemed easier to open them that way but I don’t think it makes much difference\nFitting these took about an hour, minus the painting. Total cost for two panniers, around £15 including bolts but not including the pannier mounts\nOverall, I’m fairly happy with the look. I appreciate it’s not to everyone’s taste, but it suits me\nThe boxes are 100% water and air tight (less the holes I made) and can be padlocked for security.\nThere’s no wind noise, no rattling (other than contents, but I put some thin rubber on the base inside to reduce that, and packed better). There’s no noticeable difference to how the bike rides. The only minor issue I had is the same for all hard panniers – pushing the bike means you will bump your thigh, and hoicking your leg over is a bit harder – as evidenced by the mud streak above.\nIf the storage isn’t enough, well, the front pannier mounts also have holes you can repurpose…\nPlanning some more…",

Fortunately, this information is stored in the meta database, INFORMATION_SCHEMA, so we can run a query to search it for a given user. Change USERNAME in this for the user you want to check (leaving the % wildcard at the end) and run it. If it returns results, then you will need to reconsider DROPping this user. (GUI tools will let you recreate the PROCEDURE etc, but beware that they usally DROP the routine before recreating it.

    "content": "I love my Himalayan, but the seat is not its best feature. It’s hard, strangely narrow and angles forwards. Not only giving you a numb and then increasingly painful rear end after a time riding, but also squishing your gentleman’s equipment against the fuel tank.\nMy first attempt to fix this was the buy the genuine Royal Enfield “Touring seat” for £70.80. It’s an easy swap – just remove the old and slip in the new. But, amazingly, I couldn’t tell the difference! It felt exactly the same. It wasn’t made the same; it was open underneath and there was a different mesh where it was solid in the other, but it was just as hard and uncomfortable.\nI tried with various seat-toppers. That helped a bit, as did a Sheepskin, but I needed 2 or 3 before I could ride more than an hour without a break, which left me teetering on layers of unconnected foam like the Princess and the Pea.\nI also tried using my bicycling underwear. That was surprisingly good. Then I heard about Moto Skiveez – basically the same thing but with pads specifically for adventure riding. I bought some of those. Those were a little bit better and well made, but absolutely NOT worth the £62.50 I paid for them! They are good pants, but not ten times better than basic cycling padded pants, which is what they cost. I consider Moto Skiveez to be 10% good product, 90% marketing.\nSo, figuring I might as well hack the original seat around a bit. If I messed things up, I still had the Touring seat.\nPreparation I bought a 2cm thick gel pad off Amazon for £25, watched some Youtube videos, and got to work. The Original Seat before being operated upon\nThe cover comes off easily, revealing the naked seat underneath\nNo going back now\nThe gel pad is sat underneath this (not visible), then this rubber honeycomb on top. Honestly – I’m not sure this was a great idea, maybe the pad was better closed to the bum?\nThen this soft cushion bed-topper type matirial over it all, to soften it a bit further and also widen it a bit at the front, to stop the thighs hitting the bike frame\nIt was really hard to get the staples back into the plastic, even using a pretty strong staple gun\nThe finished article. Not as pretty as the original, but is it better to sit on?\nConclusion – was it worth it? Yeeeess…? Probably? Maybe?\nThe seat is more comfortable. I’ll ride a good couple of hours (I’m a heavy bloke with a skinny bum so I’ll take extra padding every time). I did still wear a sheepskin over the saddle.\nWhat would I do differently? I’m not sure the gel pad made much difference – maybe I buried it too low so its shaping qualities were lost. So perhaps if you do the same, consider your needs a little better than I did.\nUpdate 2025: 2 years on Whilst my modification was better than the original, it still wasn’t ideal. I stripped everything back one rainy day and set-to again, focusing on much more foam. More! More! I’d bought a waterproof seat cover for something else, and once I’d added a big square of foam (from a car seat booster cushion), the original cover would no longer fit - but the extra one did. So now I finally have a comfortable seat that I can ride for 3-4 hours without feeling uncomfortable. It doesn’t look good, but I’d need professional help and a new properly fitted cover to achieve that. Upholstery is hard!",

    "content": "Backing up your important data is essential. I’ve built many systems over the years, and this is one system that I’m currently using, having thought a great deal about it. It may not be what you need, but this may be worth reading as the core concepts are pretty sound, I think.\n*What to back up? This is a core question to ask when you start planning. I think it’s quite simply answered by asking the secondary question: “Can I get the data again?” Don’t back up stuff you downloaded from the public internet unless it’s particularly rare. No TV, no Movies, no software installers. Don’t hoard data you can replace.\nDo back up stuff you’ve personally created and that doesn’t exist elsewhere, or stuff that would cause you a lot of effort or upset if it wasn’t available. Letters you’ve written, pictures you’ve taken, code you authored, configurations and systems that took you a lot of time to set up and fine tune.\nIf you want to be able to restore a full system, that’s something else and generally dealt best with disk imaging – I’m talking about individual file backups here!\nBackup Scenario Multiple household computers. Home linux servers. Many services running natively and in docker. A couple of windows computers.\nDaily backups Once a day, automate backups of your important files.\nOn my linux machines, that’s things like some directories like /etc, /root, /docker-data, some shared files.\nOn my windows machines, then that’s some mapping data, word documents, pictures, geocaching files, generated backups and so on.\nYou work out the files and get an idea of how much space you need to set aside.\nThen, with automated methods, have these files copied or zipped up to a common directory on an always-available server. Let’s call that /backup.\nThese should be versioned, so that older ones get expired automatically. You can do that with bash scripts, or automated backup software (I use backup-manager for local machines, and backuppc or robocopy for windows ones)\nHow many copies you keep depends on your preferences – 3 is a sound number, but choose what you want and what disk space you have. More than 1 is a good idea since you may not notice the next day if something is missing or broken.\nMonthly Backups – Make them Offline if possible\nI puzzled a long time over the best way to do offline backups. For years I would manually copy the contents of /backup to large HDDs once a month. That took an hour or two for a few terabytes.\nNow, I attach an external USB hard drive to my server, with a smart power socket controlled by Home Assistant.\nThis means it’s “cold storage”. The computer can’t access it unless the switch is turned on – something no ransomware knows about. But I can write a script that turns on the power, waits a minute for it to spin up, then mounts the drive and copies the data. When it’s finished, it’ll then unmount the drive and turn off the switch, and lastly, email me to say “Oi, change the drives, human”.\nOnce I get that email, I open my safe (fireproof and in a different physical building) and take out the oldest of three usb Caddies. Swap that with the one on the server and put that away. Classic Grandfather/Father/Son backups.\nOnce a year, I change the oldest of those caddies to “Annual backup, 2024” and buy a new one. That way no monthly drive will be older than three years, and I have a (probably still viable) backup by year.\nBTW – I use USB3 HDD caddies (and do test for speed – they vary hugely) because I keep a fair bit of data. But you can also use one of the large capacity USB Thumbdrives or MicroSD cards for this. It doesn’t really matter how slowly it writes, since you’ll be asleep when it’s backing up. But you do really want it to be reasonably fast to read data from, and also large enough for your data – the above system gets considerably less simple if you need multiple disks.\nError Check: Of course with automated systems, you need additional automated systems to ensure they’re working! When you complete a backup, touch a file to give you a timestamp of when it was done – online and offline. I find using tree to catalogue the files to a text file is worthwhile too, so you know what’s on there.\nLastly – test your backups. Once or twice a year, pick a backup at random and ensure you can copy and unpack the files. Ensure they are what you expect and free from errors.",

I’m fortunate to have some beautiful countryside nearby (Dartmoor – I’m in England) but even so, it’s a bit repetitive eventually.\nMy solution to this ‘problem’ is to set myself a target – to take my Himalayan to every Village in my home county of Devon.\nI’ve been doing this for a few weeks now – and about 40 villages. It’s going to take a while as there’s at least 450 of them.\nWhy?\nWell, obviously, why not?\nIt gives me a form and structure to this hobby that I quite like. I’m on the autistic spectrum, so planning and detailing such things is often as much fun as doing them, but enough flexibility that I can deviate if the mood takes me. Sometimes the bike tells me where it wants to go.\nIt’s showing me places and roads I would never normally ride, even though I’ve lived here for almost half a century. Some of them are quite technical, especially slippery fords after heavy rain, and the road surface of some of our lanes are very broken, slippery and rough – not to mention many having grass growing in the middle.\nAnd when I reach a village? Sometimes I’ll just ride through, sometimes I’ll stop and walk around. I always try and read the village noticeboard if there is one – it’s a hugely positive thing for ones mental health to realise that there’s a lot of little goodnesses going on every day, against the endless doom and gloom of the news cycles.\nThe Himalayan is the perfect bike for this. Nimble, agile, and light enough to do a U-turn within a lane, even when pointing downhill, if you meet something that can’t reverse, or the road’s blocked for some reason. It’s quiet enough not to upset horses or the wider public. It’s very economical, and just puts-puts from village to village.\nI totally understand this isn’t the sort of thing most people will enjoy spending on their days off, and that’s fine!\nHow do you keep things interesting when you’re riding for pleasure?\nThe village notice board is always worth a read",

    "content": "For almost a decade, Docker users have been complaining about a specific problem using Docker. This has affected us quite a lot, including taking around 40 docker servers running hundreds of services offline recently when I ran a script that added a local firewall rule.\nThe issue is that when Docker starts, it adds whatever rules it needs to talk to the world to the local firewall service. That’s often iptables, but also nftables and probably others. Those rules are temporary and not saved in the firewall’s configuration.\nIf the firewall is restarted for any reason (such as a sysadmin adding a new port) then those temporary rules are lost by the firewall and Docker can no longer talk to the outside world. Alerts start flashing, people get unhappy – you’ve just lost points in the game of sysadminning.\nI researching this problem, and found that Docker’s devs take the firm view that “It’s not Docker’s problem”. I can actually understand that. If other parts of the OS went away, would we expect services to continue running? Some people clearly do – and other software checks basic network continuity and will automatically heal if something like this happens. (Several examples given in the Github thread )\nBut – Docker is Docker and does what Docker does. We needed a workaround or it was only a matter of time before someone (probably me) forgot to restart docker after touching the firewall and broke things again.\nMy boss came up with what I think is an elegant solution to this ugly problem, using systemd’s [Unit] syntaxes.\nCreate a new text file, let’s call it /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/restart-docker-if-firewall-breaks.conf\nExplanation: .conf files in this directory will be added to Docker’s main .service unit file by systemd, but will both be given a higher priority in case of conflict with that, and persist during updates. Docker’s main service file can be overwritten during normal updates.\nThat file should contain this text:\n[Unit] After=iptables.service Requires=iptables.service PartOf=iptables.service Note: Replace iptables with nftables if that is your local firewall (Debian, Rocky9 etc)\nExplanation:\nAfter = Ensures that the listed unit is fully started up before the configured unit is started Requires = If this unit gets activated, the units listed will be activated as well PartOf = When systemd stops or restarts the units listed here, the action is propagated to this unit\nIn short, don’t run until iptables is already up, and if that restarts, restart docker. Reference: Systemd documentation\nLastly, we need to tell systemd about the change with systemctl daemon-reload We don’t need to restart the Docker service for this.\nTesting (Optional)\nTo test this works, restart iptables: systemctl restart iptables\nThen check docker’s service status and you should see it’s restarted recently too. systemctl status docker\nThat’s it! You can walk away and know that if the local firewall is restarted, instead of docker breaking completely, it will restart and repopulate the firewall with its own temporary rules. You might lose connection to those services briefly, but it will auto-heal.",

    "content": "Helping me find nice places\nAfter 5,000 miles and the Himalayan is pretty much perfect for me. Where they weren’t, I made some tweaks to suit me.\nA 16 tooth front sprocket - £16 This took half an hour to fit. Changing from the original 15t sprocket means that all the five gears are somewhat taller, but this allows for a much nicer on-road experience I’ve found Pros: Better economy, lower revs and vibration at motorway speeds. (RPM at 70mph drops around 600 from around 5200 to 4600) Cons: Higher first gear. Can be a stretch to fit on a new chain. Recommended? Yes, for all users except those who ride a lot of technical off road stretches where the lower 1st gear is most useful. Those riders may even consider a 14t. Clip-on screen protector - £20 A small generic clip-on screen extender. I tried the Puig screen but hated it, and the clip-on reduces buffeting enough for my 6’2″ lump. Fuelx Lite - £150 The factory tuning for all modern motorbikes is very lean to meet emissions. Devices like the FuelX sit between the oxygen sensor and the ECU and change the signals to trick the ECU into delivering more fuel. Pros: Engine runs cooler and has a stronger “pick-up” in revs, especially at the lower end. It’s easily fitted and also easy to remove. (The Pro version has handlebar buttons to change maps, which require more fitment. I went with the Lite) Cons: Slightly lowered economy. Recommended? Yes. I didn’t have high expectations of this, but I did immediately feel and hear the difference. It’s a small gain - maybe 1 or 2hp, but worth the relatively modest price, I think. Rear Pannier Frame - £50 Necessary to fit saddlebags or panniers. There are many available, but fall into two camps: Official Royal Enfield, or Copy. I bought a Copy from an Indian seller on Ebay, all of whom seem to be selling the same item. Pros: Easy to fit. Cons: Terrible quality! Initially the welds looked poor, and the metal thing. Within a year, one lower strut snapped off, having rusted through from the inside. I inspected the other and found it was also about to fail, then replaced both with some flat metal I had. After that, I lost an entire 50cal Ammo can pannier complete with all contents (Tools, spares etc) somewhere on the road one day. The top weld had snapped entirely. I spent a few hours making better mounts out of angle iron - these definitely aren’t going to fail! Recommended? No! The RE official item is probably better, but stick to branded pannier mounts. Sidestand plate - £5 Just a little plate that bolts onto the sidestand. This keeps the bike slightly more upright, but widens the footprint to stop the bike sinking on soft ground. Happy with this. Oxford Heated Grips - £60 I ride year-round and England is not a tropical country. I consider these essential on any motorbike ridden here in the grey six months of winter.\nPros: As easy to fit as they could be. Took a couple of hours, then another one to set up a relay to prevent me leaving them turned on after my ride. Cons: Ensure they don’t foul anything. I’ve seen these fitted so they can knock the kill switch off, or even lead to a sticky throttle. Recommended: Absolutely. Good value, well made, clear instructions. I use them often. GPS Mounting Bar - £24 It’s a bar that screws into the screen mounting bolts and provides somewhere to mount a GPS or phone. I added a Quadlock mount to it for my navigation phone. Doubletake Mirrors - £135 Not essential, just a bit wider than stock. I do like the OEM mirrors on the Himalayan, but even with extenders they didn’t see past my shoulders. These are slightly better, and very tough. Well made, but probably not worth the money in hindsight - you’re paying for the brand as much as the quality. Iridium spark plug. £11. Don’t bother unless you need to replace the plug anyway, then it will last longer than most. And even then I’m not certain it’s worth the extra. There’s a lot of nonsense talked about this online about it improving MPG, smoothness. I didn’t detect any changes whatsoever. 50cal ammo box luggage. £15 for 2 Bolted onto the pannier frame. I like the look and they’re waterproof, very strong and durable. EBX HH sintered front pads £18 Himalayans are known for wooden front brakes. These do make an improvement over the original pads, but there’s only so much pads can do. But they’re a cheap and small improvement if you don’t want to go down the expensive rabbit-hole of replacing the master cylinder and calipers. Replacement rear tyre: Kenda K761, £72 The original CEAT rear wore out after about 4,500 miles. These have a slightly more aggressive tread, but both behave well on-road as and off-road as I ever go. The Kendas are wearing much better and should last 50-100% longer than the CEATs Hand guards £13, generic. Essential in winter as they keep the hands warmer! They also do protect against brush hitting your knuckles - although I maintain that if you’re hitting brambles and branches that hard, you should slow down to protect against the handlebar being snatched to the side! Official Royal Enfield Touring seat. £85 I found this made no improvement to the comfort level at all and had just as much pain as the standard seat. I sold it on. PUIG Touring Screen. £95 Hated this. Bendy, flexy and made head buffetting at motorway speeds even worse! Removed and sold. A generic auto chain oiler. £14 Spent quite a long time fitting this, then discovered it emptied all its oil overnight without being touched. Removed.",

My dogs helpfully reminded me three weeks later when it started oozing liquid out through the door. Finding a home for 80kg of rotted meat in open plastic bags was one of the less fun jobs I’ve had, and trying to prevent this happening again drove me to start monitoring their temperatures.\nI currently use two methods to measure these temperatures, and have an Automation that alerts me whenever one of the temperatures goes above -5c. This should alert me if I’ve forgotten to turn it on again, as well as freezer failure or someone leaving the door open. With the average cost of a freezer’s contents being over £100, it seems like a sensible thing to do and over the years has alerted us to several non-closed doors.\nMethod 1: Onewire One method I use is to add a Onewire sensor inside a freezer by poking a small hole in the door seal by the hinges and shoving a waterproof DS18B20 sensor inside – like this:\nA onewire DS18B20 temperature sensor inside a freezer\nThis does work well and produces graphs in Home Assistant like so:\nFreezer graph. The big spikes show when the door is opened, and the little bumps are the cycling of the freezer\nThree freezers reporting to the same graph\nPros and cons of onewire in this instance: Pros: No batteries to run out Regular readings at your own requirements. Cons: The need to poke a hole in the door seal.(If you have some flat wire, you can avoid this by just closing the seal over it) Fixed wiring. This might be unsightly and time consuming to fit. I’ve used it where I had an existing Onewire run nearby. Method 2: Zigbee Temperature Sensors Wireless temperature sensors like the Aqara are cheap, reasonably accurate and small. If you have Zigbee already, then I would suggest using these.\nAn Aqara temperature sensor\nThese use CR2032 button batteries. In normal, room-temperature, situations these last for up to a year. However, in a freezer at -20, I’ve had good, branded batteries fail after 3 days!\nTo overcome this, I’ve modified my sensors to use 18650 rechargable batteries by connecting wires to the battery compartment in the Aqara that go to a battery holder. That can be in the freezer with the sensor, making a very portable little unit – or, with longer wires, outside of the freezer to stay warmer.\nAn aqara and 18650 battery+holder in a ziplock bag\nThe same thing, showing wires soldered to the compartment. Negative in the centre, positive where the CR2032 rim would touch\nWhilst the room-temperature version should last longer, in practice I have found little difference in lifespan. Both last at least six months before needing recharging.\nAn Aqara with wires soldered to the battery connectors, and sealed using hot-glue\nAn 18650 and holder, sitting between two freezers and providing power to two Aqara sensors\nIncidentally, it’s no big surprise that range is affected in these low-power sensors by putting them inside a big metal box! However, they still reach across my house to my Slae.sh Zigbee usb stick and reliability has been excellent.\nPros: Neater and quicker to install. Cons: Less regular updates – these sensors only send a reading when the temperature changes. However, in practice this is a non-problem since the freezer is always cycling and updates are adequate. Still a need to replace batteries. Potential range issues when inside a freezer. Alerting to a problem Below is my automation in Home Assistant.\nIf any of my five sensors go above -5c, then send myself a message over Telegram and run a Shell command (This plays a .wav file to a speaker that tells the house that a freezer is over temperature)\nHA’s automation for a freezer being over temperature\nAnd finally – apparently having five freezers is unusual! I have been told this!",

When I first encountered this I brushed it aside somewhat, thinking this was another example of a software memory leak, but it is controllable with three basic steps that MariaDb recommend and it’s worth spending a short amount of time making these changes.\nThese changes are intended for servers where MariaDb is the primary application. They may not suit performance for multi-role servers where Maria is a small part.\nEnsure the host has swappiness turned right down.\nMariaDb recommend this is set to 1 and we’ve found that works well. This mostly helps performance rather than memory, but it’s so basic I thought it worth including here\nHere’s MariaDb’s reference piece showing how to do this. Ensure the host has Transparent Huge Pages disabled.\nFor us, this made maria’s memory requirements a lot more stable. The gradual increase in memory used we’d seen was entirely gone.\nMariaDb’s guide on disabling THPs Use a more suitable memory manager than most distros ship with.\nMost distros ship with a memory allocation library that has to compromise to suit a wide range of uses. MariaDb, like other databases, uses memory quite aggressively in that it’s constantly changing what’s stored. Fortunately there’s at least two more suitable libraries freely available to use.\nWe use jemalloc most commonly, but also had some success with tcmalloc. Both ship with Rocky Linux and Debian and are quick and easy to install and then enable via systemd.\nMariaDb’s guide to using tcmalloc or jemalloc I’ve also written about this in another post here Conclusion All of these changes are part of our basic New Database Server build profile now and we’ve been using them for a long time. We no longer over-commit on memory to ensure stability, as the usages can be controlled via MariaDb’s configuration settings (notably innodb_buffer_pool_size ) and monitoring shows some nicely flat memory graphs after they’ve initially populated.",

This is especially noticed in larger and busier database servers.\nOften, despite looking like a memory leak in the application, this is actually a problem of fragmented memory not being aggressively cleaned by the malloc (memory allocation) library used.\nFortunately, it is a fairly easy thing to solve by installing one of two freely available libraries, jemalloc or tcmalloc, and telling mariadb to use it instead of the OS’s default. These more tightly monitor and defragmented memory pages.\nReal life scenario A company with a number of MariaDb servers running on Centos 7 and 8 often saw memory usage increasing beyond what it should have until oomkiller was activated which killed MariaDb as the biggest memory usage on the server. MariaDb restarted and all was well again until it happened again, some days later. Increasing memory on the server just delayed the inevitable – MariaDb would appear to keep using more and more memory until there was nothing left. They switched to jemalloc and the problem simply went away with no ill effects. Performance was unchanged and they made it a part of their standard database server build.\nJemalloc or TCMalloc? I’ve used jemalloc personally with a great amount of success. In all but one extremely busy server, it has completely solved the “memory leakage” effect. In that remaining server – which jemalloc did slow down the rate of growth, I’m planning to trial tcmalloc which has been performing well on a test machine for some months, and others have reported success with tcmalloc where jemalloc wasn’t much help.\nWhy is this needed? Not all memory management operates in the same way, and as there are different needs for a database than a GUI or general use application on a computer, so there are different libraries that prioritise in different way. The two libraries we’re looking at are more aggressive at defragmenting memory pages in particular, which is one reason that leads to memory getting used up.\nManagedServer has a good explanation with more detailed information here\nSteps to enable jemalloc for MariaDb Install the jemalloc library In EL (Rocky) distros, that may look something like\nyum install jemalloc\nOn Debian and alike, that may be:\napt install libjemalloc2\nLocate the actual library file In EL, this is currently /usr/lib64/libjemalloc.so.2\nIn Debian, this is currently /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjemalloc.so.2\n(If you can’t find it, you could use mlocate with updatedb\u0026\u0026locate libjemalloc to find it)\nCreate a drop-in systemd file for mariadb with an Environment statement to tell MariaDb it needs to load the library. Create a new text file called this containing two lines as below. Change the path to the library file after ‘Environment=’ to match the above. /etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/mariadb_tcmalloc.conf [Service] Environment='LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libjemalloc.so.2' Tell systemd to scan for that file, and then restart MariaDb systemctl daemon-reload systemctl restart mariadb And that should be it!\nSteps to enable TCMalloc for MariaDb The process is almost identical as for jemalloc, just change the package and library to tcmalloc.\nFor Debian, the package to install is currently libtcmalloc-minimal4 and that puts the library file at /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtcmalloc_minimal.so.4 Verifying it worked To see which malloc library MariaDb is using, just run the following SQL query in MariaDb:\nSHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'version_malloc_library'; This should report something useful like, for TCMalloc;\nversion_malloc_library tcmalloc gperftools 2.10\nThat’s it. MariaDb is now running a more suitable alloc library!",

Wait five minutes and then turn them back off. If more movement is detected, reset the timer. Even Better:\nThe automations work by time. After 10PM when we’re more likely to be going to bed, the same automation applies but only sets the lights at 5%. This is just bright enough to see by. These are better than standalone “movement lights” because: They never run out of battery. They can be linked in many creative ways depending where that movement is detected. For example: Front door opens? We probably want most lights on. But if it’s bedroom movement at night, chances are it’s just the hall and bathroom that are needed. Monitoring Freezer Temperatures Problem: What happens if a freezer is unplugged or breaks down when it’s full of food, and you don’t notice it immediately?\nHistory: We used to feed our dogs on a raw meat diet. That meant buying a lot of meat, all packages in 500g plastic bags and kept in a half-sized freezer in the house. It was actually the overflow dog food freezer so had been left turned off before hand. We had a delivery that filled the primary freezer so I put the overflow in this one. 30kg of raw meat. What I didn’t do, was turn the freezer back on… A fortnight later, we noticed the dogs were sniffing at the freezer and licking it, and when I opened it, rotting meat fell out. Cleaning that up was not a fun game… (Fortunately we had a farmer friend who was able to dispose of the meat, but we still had to remove and bag it up to get it outside, then do a big cleanup job. Quite an incentive to prevent it re-occurring, right?\nSolution: Monitor the internal temperature of each freezer (We had five at one point) and raise alerts if any of them went above -5’c\nI’ve written a page about this project here",

    "content": "We turned off PRTG this week after migrating to Zabbix. Here’s what we learned along the way.\n(These are the personal views and findings of a sysadmin tasked with finding something to replace PRTG as our main monitoring system. They do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer.)\nWe’re a tech based SME with some 500 vm and physical servers. Some linux, some windows, plus the usual assortment of network and edge case devices. Nothing particularly unusual about us.\nWe first started using PRTG some seven or so years ago. At the time it was the best choice by far, and we thought the licence costs reasonable. It’s been a faithful servant in that time, and we consider it a critical system, especially when our other critical systems had failure. We liked the ability to run user scripts, and got used to the sometimes strange UI and all of our team were, by and large, able to use it well.\nOngoing problems with PRTG were the 2,500 sensor cap – we always had to keep an eye on that and had regular housekeeping sessions removing things we didn’t need or PRTG would start disabling monitors if the number exceeded our cap. The WMI sensors would sometimes fail, and – especially in the last year – the PRTG server itself has been prone to instability. Sometimes it would stop sending network traffic to its clients and put everything into alarm, notifying dozens of people out of hours – which was obviously not popular and undermined confidence in it a lot. We’d also not seen much in the way of improvements in PRTG over the time we used it. Granted, we weren’t crying out for change, but it felt like it was under-developed.\nBut none of the problems were big enough to consider changing, until Paessler were sold to the capital fund group, Turn/River, who quickly raised the prices. Paessler quoted us a revised fee on renewal which equated to around a 400% increase in cost. On the heels of the Broadcom acquisition of VMWare, we were quite sensitive to vendor lock-in and the squeezes being applied to customers in the industry, and myself and a colleague were given the task of considering alternatives to PRTG.\nWe quickly thought of Zabbix – after all, it has been around for ages and has a pretty good reputation. We set up a new linux vm, installed Zabbix and started to figured out how to automatically add most of our machines and quickly had a few hundred machines added.\n(The process we used was: Linux machines – add the zabbix repo for our EL and Debian machines. Install zabbix-agent2. Change two lines in the zabbix-agent2.conf to tell it to use its own hostname and the address of the Zabbix server. For Windows – much the same, just using PDQ to deploy the package and conf. With some auto-add subnet rules on Zabbix server, each new client would connect and be added with the right basic settings.)\nAnd.. We’re happy. We turned off PRTG’s vm on Tuesday feeling confident we had everything monitored that needed to be, and had a whole lot more covered on top.\nHere’s some takeaways if you’re thinking of doing the same thing Zabbix is good. Everything we did in PRTG is also doable in Zabbix.\nStart from scratch. There’s no “Press this button and migrate” option available to migrate from PRTG to Zabbix and even if there were, something like this is a good chance not to repeat previous design mistakes. You can export a list of devices from PRTG that may be a useful reference, but we have well defined subnet and were able to automatically discover most of our devices from the originating IP and have them appear in the correct host groups and have the right default templates assigned to them.\nWe can see more of our estate. We’ve increased our sensors from 2,500 to 43,000 and no longer have to spend time housekeeping to keep them within licence, or risk things going unmonitored because PRTG has turned sensors off because we exceeded our allowance.\nZabbix uses fewer resources. Despite handling almost twenty times the datapoints, at the server end, we’ve reduced ram from 16g to 8g and cpus from 4 to 2 and are keeping sysload consistently low. The disk sizes (2nd disk for a local mysql server exclusively for zabbix) is 110gb for Zabbix, vs 130gb used by prtg. On the clients, the lack of LDAP/SSH connections from PRTG every minute has been noticable – we monitor these for intrusion detection so there is a secondary interpretive load on ssh connections that we can bypass with Zabbix’s direct port connection. There is obviously some increased memory usage by having an agent running all the time with Zabbix but we think it’s remarkably meager. A glance at some clients now shows 16mb ram used by the windows agent and 27mb by the linux one. Disk footprint is less than 100mb for each.\nQuids in. We’re saving around $9,000 per year in licencing. As a company, we like FOSS and try to give back in some way. My employers are happy for us to submit bug reports, help in forums and sometimes submit PRs to resolve bugs directly. Sometimes we buy support or training from the company. Everyone wins with FOSS.\nZabbix is more stable. We haven’t had a single crash from either server or agent in six months. Meanwhile, PRTG had crashed up to twice a week, usually needing manual intervention to reboot the vm and get it going again. (It didn’t used to do this, so we think it’s a problem with the latest version)\nChanging at scale is fun! Do everything with templates and try to get this right the first time. We can now change settings for templates, apply new templates, and essentially change how every sensor operates with a few clicks. Templates can be linked and values are inheritied with default macros controlling specific things. Want to change the default warning for a low disk space alert? Just change the macro once in the template and suddenly everything is the same. Want that, but also have some servers that need different thresholds? Local Macros override the template, so you can do that too – nice! Having previously had to work through dozens or hundreds of sensors with PRTG to change values was quite tiresome. There may have been a better way that we never found.\nMaking bespoke sensors is easy – once you know how. We all have “those” pet machines which need something special monitoring. Adding UserParameter checks and monitors allows us to consume anything that can be generated on the command line and alert based on its value. (In fairness, bespoke sensors work quite well in PRTG too, no shade to be cast there) Because Zabbix supports .d/ config fragments, we can easily add these at scale to target host groups by deploying a new file just with the relevant UserParameter, and then a new template to import that Item and a Trigger.\nThere is a learning curve. Zabbix is a complicated piece of software and it’s not reasonable to expect to pick it up within a few days. However, the documentation is fairly good. Sometimes I found the official docs sparse – examples would be nice, or an explanation of what that feature was actually doing.The engineering decisions do make sense once you understand them, and it’s obvious that the core development team are not only passionate about the project, but technically very skilled too. Is the learning curve steeper than PRTG’s? Hard to say as it’s a subjective thing, but maybe a little, but not so much that too much time was spent on any one problem.\nZabbix is compatible. Not only does the Zabbix website provide regularly updated installers for all of our OS choices and linux repositories for automatic updating, we’re also sending alerts to Mattermost, email and Teams with varying levels of intentional delay and logic. It also talks to all our equipment in more ways than PRTG did, and more types of equipment than PRTG did. Adding monitoring via SNMP is never fun, but we found it easier with Zabbix than PRTG.\nThe Grafana Plugin actually works! PRTG has never had an official plugin for grafana, and the community created plugin by neuralfraud was abandoned years ago. The angular framework that it uses is now deprecated by Grafana and will stop working soon, if it hasn’t already. Additionally, the PRTG plugin was bugged and we found that it often randomly reported latency instead of values which made the graphs rather useless. By contrast, Grafana has a native, modern and fast plugin for Zabbix that “Just works”. It’s been a genuine pleasure to migrate our extensive dashboards over to Zabbix.\nSupport. As a free user, we obviously have no guaranteed SLA with Zabbix like with did with PRTG, but support contracts are available if that is important to your business. We did use PRTG’s support a few times and they were fine. Community support is important to both, but Zabbix’s community is very large, and in particular, there are far more templates available for different types of kit than for PRTG. We have had to write a few bespoke things, but we’ve also saved time by using those already available for Zabbix. The community forums are the usual mixed bag, with outdated or incorrect advice often given, and I wouldn’t exactly call them friendly to the novice - a few people prefer to criticise than be helpful - but sadly this is the case with public support. But when I posted about a specific question relating to device id’s, I did get two useful responses within 24 hours.\nTraining. We were aware of the professional training courses available for Zabbix users but we opted not to avail ourselves of it. Perhaps those with less free time may find it saves them time in getting to grips. We didn’t use training from PRTG when we set that up, either.\nTimescale. We allowed six months of low priority project time for this migration, and it was a fairly comfortable timespan for us.\nConclusion As you can tell, I’m a bit of a convert to Zabbix!\nMonitoring systems aren’t easily changed for companies, and that’s probably why PRTG’s new owners ramped up the pricing so much – “vendor lock-in” is real. Some customers will undoubtedly accept the new pricing because they will find it difficult to move to something else, don’t have the time or skill to set something else up, or consider it cheaper than migration costs. Fair enough and I wish them well.\nMy purpose of writing this is to try and give a fairly balanced view of someone who has taken that step and to help inform others of what’s involved.\nI am not a part of the Zabbix project and don’t represent them in any way. We did research some alternatives, both commercial and FOSS, but Zabbix is so large in the sector that we did lean that way from the start.\nThank you, and good luck in whatever monitoring path you choose. May your alerts never be false.\nSix months on As I copy this article across to Hugo for yet another new version of my site, have my feelings changed?\nNo, they haven’t. I’m even more impressed with Zabbix than I was. We’ve had no problems with it and have gained a fair bit of admin time that was spent tending to PRTG’s increasingly delicate reliability. We’ve had no more worried employees concerned about what turned out to be false alarms, to the point we’ve forced problems to ensure the alerting does actually work!\nZabbix server has been faultless. Not a single crash.\nWe have had the Zabbix agent stop a few times on Windows clients. That shows up within 5 minutes, and we only noticed because it was set not to automatically restart. Changing the service entry to restart on failure means that’s a problem we’ve only had to solve once.\nOtherwise, it’s brilliant. We’re up to around 30,000 items being monitored across some 500 devices on a low spec vm (2x vcpus, 8gb ram) PRTG simply cannot compete at any level with Zabbix - except perhaps the UI, which may be slightly nicer. But not worth the cost, either financially or in terms of upkeep.",

This isn’t so much a demonstration of how you should do, more a hall of shame of how I’ve done it…\nNaked ESP dangling from its USB supply This one measured my classic car’s battery voltage so has a little daughter board to step that down. And no, I’m not proud of that negative connection.\nElectrical tape wound around the ESP and connecting wires Terrible. Never do this.\nA plastic bag taped closed This was surprisingly effective for a zero effort container that didn’t need any ongoing work. Keeps the dust off, stops short circuits. Might suffer from overheating if you run a very hot chip, but for my 8266’s it was fine.\nAn Electrical Socket Specifically, a deep backing box for surface mount. Lots of space, heat rated plastic, handy knockouts for wire entry and screw mounting. Top with a blanking plate (or even an actual light switch or socket) and it blends right in – until someone tries to use it.\nAn outside light switch I had an old one of these with a broken switch when I was looking for a container to use outside and it fit the bill. Handy grommits to run wires, totally waterproof – worked great!\nA takeaway food container With the lid on, it keeps dust out nicely. A little bubble wrap ensures it sleeps soundly.\nThis was actually my first “proper” ESP project! The 12v incoming supply to the breakaway board feeds power to the 12v PIRs. The cat5 brings wires connected to the zones of my old and broken home burglar alarm. Running Konnected, the esp8266 has been feeding house movement and door/window sensor information to Home Assistant for over half a decade like this!\nVarious “Project Boxes” These are perfectly useful, but probably my least favourite containers to use. They’re quite expensive and so predictable!\nThe rugged aluminium speaker and electronics boxes from a heavy plant reversing system I was lucky enough to score a big box full of these things at a local auction for a quid. They’re about 250x100mm by about 50mm deep - lots of space and made of aluminium so really strong.\nThey did have a bunch of lights and buttons on the front, which is why I’ve rivetted some ally across the holes here.\nA picture of the insides. The green things on the left are connector blocks, so I can just unplug the box and take it away without all the pain of reconnecting the sensor wires afterwards_. _Being able to replace the ESP from the breakaway board is a great thing too – I have had issues where I needed to remove it to reflash after a bodged over-the-air update and this layout made that easy.",

    "content": "Landy #1 – JFK 893C JFK 893C\nI saw a beautiful Series 2a on the original 1965 registration plates advertised on Ebay and “Locked on”. I checked with the wife to ensure that my thinking wasn’t too off-par. One of the side effects of depression is of course that it undermines your confidence in every way – and especially that you’re making good decisions. She told me that if I wanted it, I should have it!\nSo a phone call later and I was at a nice property 40 minutes away. The chap seemed to like the idea of owning a land rover, but wasn’t too pleased with the reality. He struggled to get behind the wheel (I did notice the seats were deeper than the original) and he had a poorly hip, so preferred to use his Porsche 4×4. I took a good look around and liked what I saw and promptly offered the full asking price if he had it delivered. Things were pointed out like the “Wiring needs fixing up” (Turned out to need a front-end rewire), Chassis is okay (it wasn’t bad and didn’t need any work) and that the Bulkhead had been replaced.\nLessons from this were: When the oil is clean and the battery is flat so it can’t be started, be suspicious. It turned out the head gasket was blown and the first time I ran it the oil turned to milk. Quite naughty, that. The staining under the Landy turned out to be a leaking fuel tank that needed replacing. “Finishing the wiring is a five minute job”. Of course it wasn’t. If it was, wouldn’t the owner have done it before trying to sell? Of course, I rationalised the purchase first in that if I was going to learn how to repair vehicles, this was a perfect example. The value of Series Land Rovers is appreciating quickly and I was hoping not to lose money as I learned. Truthfully, this was an emotional decision. Now this project is nearly complete, I don’t regret a moment of it. Even though I eventually left my job after 22 years, being able to switch off from it and focus on the Land Rover undoubtedly helped my recovery. It’s also taught me some very useful skills and given me the confidence with Vehicles to repair my Toyota Yaris as well as the Wife’s Shogun, saving many hundreds of pounds of labour.\nArrival Harry feeling the late snows before the roof’s on\nFirst things first, I had to built Harry a home. I wasn’t going to leave him outside to get ruined. I’d made this mistake with a kit car previously, a very pretty JBA Falcon. Even a tarpaulin “Tunnel garage” wasn’t much better, causing condensation. I roughed up some plans and built a car port outside of my garage/workshop.\nStarting work Now that I had ‘Harry’ home, I set to getting it running. Charging the battery got it started quite easily, but it ran rough.\nAfter turning it off, I checked the oil and… Found it white and foamy. Only really one thing that can be – a blown head gasket. Bugger!\nHaving had a few cars sent to the scrapyard for just this problem, I was quite alarmed!\nDespondent, I muttered for a while, then watched a few youtube videos and wondered just how hard it might be to do this. Everything seemed surprisingly simple, and that the Land Rover Series engine was about as easy to work on as any. So I decided to give it a go and, following the trusty Haynes manual, removed the rocker cover to be greeted with the classic grey sludge.\nMilky deposits inside the rocker cover\nThen came the head, and I spent a few hours cleaning it up and painting it;\nHead off, cleaned and painted\nIt was at this point that I noticed a tiny crack leading out from one of the ports. I asked around and was given the name of an engine specialist in Totnes and on ringing him, he said to “bring it down for a look”. I happened to be going that way the next day so I stopped by (complete with a car full of work colleagues) and I was told, firmly but kindly, that “It’s scrap. I could weld it, but it’ll never hold in that place.” Bugger again!\nSmall but deadly crack\nIt turned out that one of my work colleagues knew someone who knew someone who might have a spare cylinder head, so I was given a number and sure enough, this chap thought he had one. I met him the next day (he only lived a couple of miles away) and sure enough, he’d removed the head from a Series 3 engine that was identical (An Ex SWEP cherry picker). This new head had been lying on its side in the weather for a few years, which made separating the manifolds a major effort (about four hours worth!) and the the ports were full of crud and the valve stems had rotted out. Fortunately, I could use the manifolds from my old head.\nState of the new head upon collection - it took four hours to separate the manifolds\nProtecting the block whilst I work on the head\nOld and new heads, together with thermostat housing and oil filler cap\nSeveral more hours and I’d succeeded in cleaning up the ‘new’ head fairly well, including polishing all the ports. I lapped in the original valves using the handy rubber-hose-and-cordless-drill technique which worked very nicely, broke a new set of valve spring compressors.\nNew head gasket in place with copper sealant\nHead back on, Manifold mountings cleaned and new gasket in place, ready\nNearly all re-assembled\nJob done! The feeling of going through this, as a novice, and actually getting a working engine again was brilliant. I needed to re-adjust the tappets a bit but the new head proved good and I did a few hundred miles without any further problems.\nI also replaced quite a few parts - radiator, fuel tank, full service, greased, oiled and painted everything I could, including a full repaint of the exterior. (Landies are one of the few vehicles which don’t need a professional paint booth to look good - at least in my opinion!)\nIt was around then that I saw a 1974 Series 3 Land Rover for sale nearby, and I made the decision to sell the Series 2. It duly sold and went to a nice chap in Japan where I believe it still is today, being loved and used.\nTimothy,the Series 3 This turned into another long affair. This one came from a chap who had sadly died but who loved it. He had just fitted a reconditioned engine but health had prevented him finishing the job. I still have this Landy today and enjoy tinkering with it.",
