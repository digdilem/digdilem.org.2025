<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>

<h3 id="about-this-website">About this Website</h3>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Digital Dilemma is a name used by it’s creator, Simon Avery, since around 1990 relating to computer related services.</p>
<h3 id="early-1990s--round-corner-software--digital-dilemma">Early 1990s – Round Corner Software / Digital Dilemma</h3>
<p>I founded and ran a Public Domain / Shareware company that distributed cassette tapes and 3″ 178Kb disks of free software for the Amstrad CPC. Some of it was my own text adventures, but mostly other peoples. Back then, this was the standard way to distribute software that wasn’t on sale in the local shops. People would request some selections, I’d copy them to the requested media and post them in a jiffy bag. Commercially it was a flop, but it was only ever intended to cover the postage costs.</p>
<h3 id="early-1990s-to-around-2005--digital-dilemma-bbs-also-fidonet-225590-and-22550">Early 1990s to around 2005 – Digital Dilemma BBS. Also Fidonet 2:255/90 and 2:255/0</h3>
<p>When I first upgraded my 1200/75 modem to a 14.4kbps one, I decided to run a BBS. This required renting a dedicated phone line from BT (not a cheap thing back then). It was fun to listen to the click of the modem when it answered a call and then go and see what the user was doing. Whether they were downloading files, playing one of the Door Games like Lord of the Green Dragon, or reading messages.</p>
<p>I eventually got further into messaging and ran a point system from another BBS. From there, I applied and was granted my own node number, 2:255/90 (UK, Regional Southwest). Fidonet mail was generally sorted into different topics and each downlink would require an archive created containing the mail topics they’d subscribed to, plus any direct email (called netmail) for them or their users. Because every phone call was chargable, this was optimised and automated to be as efficient as possible. Highly compressed files created ready to be collected and even with the low linespeeds of the day, a typical send and receive would be done in a few seconds. We don’t need that level of efficiency nowadays, with fast, always-on connections. I still have some software I wrote to help this available here.</p>
<p>There were also multiple other mail networks, many specialist-interest or more lax than Fidonet’s rather stuffy rules – topics were always moderated and kept on-topic. (With the exception of CONTROV, a lawless wild place!) I forget the name of many of them now – but Landnet was one, and Blush Response ran its own network and I’m still in touch with many from there even now.</p>
<p>Sometimes around 2000, the main UK Mail Coordinator, John Burden, retired through ill health and I took over the role. He had run a Midnight Line to bring mail into the UK and send it out to other countries. A Midnight Line was a product sold by BT where, for an hour a day, phone calls anywhere were not directly charged. Instead, you paid a fixed fee and I understand that was considerable.</p>
<p>Eventually, Fidonet throughput trickled away as people moved onto the internet and sometime around 2005, I called it a day and closed Digital Dilemma.</p>
<h3 id="websites">Websites</h3>
<p>The first Digital Dilemma website appeared on the internet around 1995 as a free btinternet site. I didn&rsquo;t register the <code>digdilem.org</code> domain until 2001.</p>
<h3 id="then-to-now">Then to now</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s 2025 and I&rsquo;ve been publishing a personal website for around thirty years.</p>
<p>The method has changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hand written HTML</li>
<li>Dreamweaver HTML</li>
<li>Wordpress on a VPS</li>
<li>Jekyll hosted on Github</li>
<li>Wordpress hosted via Cloudflare Tunnel on my home server</li>
<li>In this latest iteration, Hugo hosted by Cloudflare pages</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s no formal company, product or service attached to Digital Dilemma. I use digdilem as a nick in a great many places and I’ve generally provided this site, in some form or another, mostly to house a few projects and share some information.</p>
<p>I hope this site is useful in some small way.</p>

  <em>An old geek from Dartmoor</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a labourer, tree surgeon, van driver, maintenance worker, fundraiser and managing director of a horse charity.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m a Linux Sysadmin happily working for a Sports company in Exeter, England.</p>
<p>I have always been a geek, and fairly recently self-diagnosed as Autistic. This follows an early formal diagnosis of Dyslexia. Re-evaluating my life with this information has led to a lot of &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; moments&hellip;</p>
<h4 id="programming-and-computer-experience">Programming and computer experience</h4>
<ul>
<li>1980s: <strong>BASIC, Quill, Adlan, GAC</strong> <em>A fun time and the 8-bit Text Adventure scene in Britain at that time was lively and exciting. I sold several games, mostly through WoW Software. (RIP Joan)</em></li>
<li>1990s: <strong>TADS, Borland Turbo-C</strong>  <em>I ran a BBS for over a decade, and much of my C coding was developing tools for that.</em></li>
<li>2000s: <strong>Perl, PHP, Bootstrap, SQL</strong> <em>At this point I was asked to write a database to manage the horses for our family&rsquo;s equine charity. This evolved into a major CRM that grew with the charity until it was managing close to a thousand horses, 150 staff and all the inter-relationships. This was written entirely in Perl CGI, using MySql as a backend</em></li>
<li>2010s: <strong>Bash, Python, lots more perl and SQL</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the late 90s, I made a major career change and was lucky enough to get a job with a great employer as a Linux Sysadmin. All my adult life I&rsquo;d lived in awe of these super beings, and suddenly I was one. Imposter syndrome was huge and the learning curve was steep!</p>
<ul>
<li>2020s: Linux, specialising in EL (Centos, RHEL, Rocky), Debian. MariaDb administration. Uyuni. Grafana. PRTG. Zabbix. Docker and the dozens of other stacks that sysadmins need to know.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="hobbies">Hobbies:</h4>
<ul>
<li>DIY, land maintenance.</li>
<li>Home Automation, mostly using a very large and completely unnecessary Home Assistant setup.</li>
<li>Walking, Cycling, Geocaching <em>Since some heart trouble, this is now less</em></li>
<li>Motorcycling with the occasional easy green lane.</li>
<li>Vehicle maintenance and restoring old vehicles.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-dartmoor-archive">The Dartmoor Archive</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>*Dartmoor is a vast, wild, and rugged upland area in Devon, England, characterized by extensive granite tors, heather-clad moorland, and deep river valleys. It&rsquo;s a national park known for its dramatic landscapes, rich prehistoric archaeology including stone circles and hut circles, and unique wildlife, as well as its iconic Dartmoor ponies that roam freely. The area is steeped in history and folklore, offering diverse opportunities for walking, exploration, and experiencing a truly untamed natural environment.&quot; &ndash; Gemini AI when asked to sum up Dartmoor.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dartmoor means a lot to a lot people. To me it is my freedom and my cathedral, a place to be myself and reset my mind. I&rsquo;ve lived and worked on or near it for most of my life and it&rsquo;s core to who I am now. There are many beautiful places in the World, but this one means the most to me.</p>
<p>As years pass, some valuable Dartmoor websites have been abandoned or become at risk of being lost. I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to be in a position to be able to adopt and maintain those. This isn&rsquo;t something I charge for, I do it simply to save the information and preserve it as best I can for as long as I can.</p>
<p>If you know of a Dartmoor related website that can no longer be maintained, please let me know and I&rsquo;ll try to arrange transfer with the owner, if they&rsquo;re willing.</p>
<p>These are the sites I&rsquo;m looking after:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://dartmoorwalking.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">Dartmoor Walking</a>
This site was entirely created by me, but using some of Keith Ryan&rsquo;s guides and pictures from his Dartmoor Cam website. The intention was to create a more accessible and modern collection of walks to help people enjoy Dartmoor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://dartmoorletterboxing.digdilem.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">The Dartmoor Letterboxing Forum</a>
<em>Formerly: <a href="https://www.dartmoorletterboxing.org" rel="external" target="_blank">www.dartmoorletterboxing.org</a>, now expired</em>
The original forum for Dartmoor Letterboxing, dating back well over two decades. Sadly, Letterboxing is in decline, primarily (in my view) because it&rsquo;s so hard for new people to get a toehold as many boxes are Word-of-mouth only, combined with the popularity of Geocaching.
However, the historical posts are worth preserving. It was impossible to archive the forum as a functional PHPBB site and keep it secure, so I have exported the posts as static HTML pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://dartmoorcam.co.uk/" rel="external" target="_blank">Dartmoor Cam</a>
Created by Keith Ryan, a well known local Walker and lover of Dartmoor, this is a very rich source of walks with excellent descriptions, photos and maps.
Sadly, Keith died in 2023 after illness. I worked with him and his Wife to migrate these pages across to preserve them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://dartmoorticks.digdilem.org" rel="external" target="_blank">Dartmoor Tick Watch</a>
A survey of ticks on Dartmoor up to 2009, organised and collated by Keith Ryan.
The original domain will expire in 2025, so I&rsquo;ve added it as a sub-site of my domain.
The Cornish Pasty “The Compleat Pastypaedia“
Simultaneously deeply knowledgeable and humorous study of traditional Cornish cuisine, again by Keith Ryan.</p>

<p><em>A fun little project that has a useful function for me – wirelessly connecting a vehicle battery to Home Assistant.</em></p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: I wanted to be able to check my vehicle&rsquo;s battery was good, and automatically alert me if it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I own a classic Land Rover that doesn&rsquo;t get driven enough, and I wanted to keep an eye on the battery voltage so that I knew when to put it on charge, using HA to alert me when it dropped below a certain point. That worked well for a while, but then I had much worse problems with my Motorbike which, despite two new batteries, went low enough to fail to start after only 10 days. I spent a long time trying to sort out the parasitic drain, but the general advice was “They all do that”. So I got a Optimate battery tender that trickle-charges it. The only problem was remembering to plug the thing in! So I moved my widget across to the bike shed and connected it directly to the 12v feed on the tender. Now, if I forget to plug it back in and the voltage drops below 12.6v, I get a SMS telling me I&rsquo;ve been forgetful.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardware">The Hardware:</h2>
<ul>
<li>A nodemcu ESP8266 board circuit board (Other boards will work too)</li>
<li>A power shield to step the incoming ~12v voltage down to a level that the ESP8266 can accept</li>
<li>A car cigarette-lighter USB adapter (To stop the 12v down to ~5v and power the ESP8266)</li>
<li>A box to keep it in (I used a standard UK wall-mount socket with blanking plate, but any box works as long as it provides some protection against knocks and the weather if it&rsquo;s exposed to them. I&rsquo;ve even used Chinese Takeaway containers)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Notes: If you&rsquo;re running the ESP from a separate power supply, perhaps by measuring the voltage coming out of a trickle-charger instead of directly to the battery, you obviously won&rsquo;t need any 12 -&gt; 5v adapter</em></p>

<h2 id="esphome-code">ESPHome code:</h2>
<p>Esphome makes programming chips really as easy as it could be. I&rsquo;ve always been interested in doing this, but had struggled with the thought of soldering and electronics generally. No need for any of that with this project.</p>
<p>I installed esphome on a little low power PC that runs Debian and connected the ESP8266 via a usb lead. I then followed their instructions for creating a new project, and wrote the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>esphome:
  name: voltage
  platform: ESP8266
  board: nodemcu

  # Enable fallback hotspot (captive portal) in case wifi connection fails
  ap:
    ssid: &#34;Esphome Voltage Fallback Hotspot&#34;
    password: &#34;WifiPass&#34;

captive_portal:

#  run_duration: 20s
#  sleep_duration: 10min

sensor:
  - platform: adc
    pin: A0
    name: &#34;Bike Voltage&#34;
    update_interval: 60s
    filters:
      - multiply: 24.8</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="notes-about-the-code">Notes about the code:</h2>
<ul>
<li>I first used this code on my Landrover, which took power from the main battery. The deep_sleep section puts the chip into a very low power state which saved a lot of drain. As my bike is connected to the output wires from a trickle charger, I commented out this section as I no longer need it.</li>
<li>The <em>multiply</em>: value of 24.8 took quite a lot of trial and error to be accurate. I used a reliable multimeter on the same voltage source on my bench and then experimented with this until it matched. The power shield steps the voltage down to below the 3.3v that the chip can accept. If you connect 12v directly to the chip, it&rsquo;s going to blow, so reducing it, reading it and then multiplying that value is the only way for this to work. Sounds quite hacky but it&rsquo;s surprising how often solutions like this exist to get around such problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is then compiled by esphome and and uploaded to the chip via the usb lead and starts running.</p>
<p>Any future updates to this code can be done without connecting it – esphome will connect to the device over the wifi connection and, by magic, update the code remotely!</p>
<p>ESPHome also runs as an integration in Home Assistant, and once installed, will automatically register new devices to itself.</p>

<p>That entity this integration creates is then available within HA to do anything we want with. We can stick it on HA&rsquo;s own dashboard like so</p>

<p>And, by exporting it to Grafana, show prettier graphs of any range we like. In this one, we see the battery tender going through a cycle of topping up the battery, then sleeping for a bit, then repeating.</p>

</p>
<p>I also have an Automation in Home Assistant that alerts me when the voltage drops below 12.2v, or stops updating for 24h as that means my bike is going to struggle to start and I&rsquo;d rather find that out before I put on all my leathers and get ready to go out! The reason is usually because I&rsquo;ve forgotten to plug it back into the charger!</p>

<h1 id="measuring-wind-with-esphome">Measuring Wind With Esphome</h1>

<p>One very windy Autumn night, I wondered just how hard was the wind blowing? Spotting a cheap anenometer on Ebay, I figured it was worth trying to add this to my HA setup. It turned out to be surprisingly easy and in just an afternoon, things were up and working beautifully.</p>
<p>

<h2 id="the-physical-bits">The Physical Bits</h2>
<ul>
<li>One Anenemeter, a HADEX WH1080.
<ul>
<li>Although pretty much any pulse-based meter will work.</li>
<li>It has two wires and putting a multimeter across them, I saw that one full revolution opens and closes these wires three times. Considering how fast these things can spin, that’s going to take a lot of counting!</li>
<li>I extended the wiring by soldering and heat-shrinking a 5 meter length of bell wire onto it, then tested again.</li>
<li>I mounted it on a shelf bracket with a suitable sized bolt that neatly screws into the mount, as i don’t have the full weather-station kit this unit comes with. This sits near my garage, although it’s not a great position since it’s quite sheltered. However, this is just a fun little project and I’m not too worried about its accuracy, and I won’t be sharing speeds with anyone else.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One ESP8266 or ESP32 or similar chip.
<em>I’ve used a Nodemcu chip without any additional backboarding or hats. I put it in an old light-switch box just for some protection from knocks.</em></li>

</p>
<h2 id="connecting-the-bits">Connecting the bits</h2>
<p>The ESP8266 connects to HA by wifi, so it only needs a USB power supply and whatever connections we’re poking into it.</p>
<p>The Anenometer has two wires, and they open and close three times per revolution. It shouldn’t matter which way around they are connecting as we only care that they open and close.</p>
<p>I connected these to pins GND and GPIO14 next to it (which is Pin D4 on the board) – see this useful reference for the NodemCPU to figure out which pins go where.</p>
<p>That’s it! One micro usb connector supplying 5v and two wires.</p>
<h2 id="the-esphome-code">The ESPHome code</h2>
<p>(I won’t cover the ‘Getting started’ bit of ESPhome – they have their own excellent documentation <a href="https://esphome.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
<p>Before I placed the ESP8266 in position, I connected it to a small Linux PC via USB and did this;</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>mkdir -p /opt/esphome/anenometer
cd /opt/esphome/anenomter
esphome wizard configuration anenometer.yaml</code></pre></div>
<p>This creates a directory for the files and changes into it, then sets up the initial yaml file for the project. Once you’ve answered some basic questions, you’re can then edit the anenometer.yaml file with the editor of your choice. (I use vi, but you do whatever you like)</p>
<p>This is what my anenometer.yaml file looks like once I’ve added in some bits</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>esphome:

      - sliding_window_moving_average:
          window_size: 100
          send_every: 100</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, to explain some of the sensor bits here that might not be self-evident:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: What Home Assistant will call this entity.</li>
<li><strong>filters</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>multiply</strong>: This is where the trial and error comes in. At this stage, I’m guessing as I have no other point of reference, but this seems roughly to match the Beaufort Scale over the past few days. Do experiment with this value yourself. (The fact this is less than 1 means the multiplication is actually a division)</li>
<li><strong>sliding_window_moving_average</strong>: This allows us to count a bunch of pulses and then send a value every N number. Without this we would be trying to send every pulse, and as each rotate is three pulses, that might not be so good.</li>
<li><strong>window_size</strong>: How many pulses to read before establishing an average number over that time. This could be much larger to eliminate gusts, but it would be much slower to update in non-windy conditions.</li>
<li><strong>send_every</strong>: How many pulses are received before sending an update to HA.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, Esphome has better and accurate documentation on each of these items <a href="https://esphome.io/components/sensor/index.html" rel="external" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>That’s about it! The config was first uploaded to the ESP8266 using esphome run anenometer.yaml and then choosing the right-looking USB port.</p>
<p>Once it’s up though, you can change this file and update the ESP8266 over the air by re-running the same command and choosing “Over the air” instead of selecting a USB port. Magic!</p>
<h2 id="one-last-thing">One last thing!</h2>
<p>You’ll need to know what IP address your new ESP8266 was given. I find this out by checking my router’s DHCP list, but you can also use arpwatch to look for new devices.</p>
<h2 id="home-assistant">Home Assistant</h2>
<p>To add the new ESP8266 device to HA, we need to</p>
<ul>
<li>Go into Settings -&gt; Devices &amp; Services in Home Assistant</li>
<li>Click Add Integration</li>
<li>Select ESPHome</li>
<li>Enter the IP Address of your new ESP8266 (See ‘One Last Thing!’ above) and leave the default port of 6053 as it is. Click Submit.</li>
<li>Your new device should appear in the ESPhome panel on the Integrations page, and selecting it will show it has one entity – which should be called Windspeed and have the entity id of sensor.windspeed_meter</li>
<li>Clicking on that entry, and into the Info tab should show some data, and after a little while, look something like this</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h1 id="using-one-wire-sensors-in-esphome">Using One Wire sensors in ESPHome</h1>

<p>Onewire / 1wire / one wire / Dallas / Maxim is a very cheap way to deploy single or multiple temperature sensors, plus some other devices such as mini wireless buttons.</p>
<p>I’ve been using them at my house for around twelve years with lots of success, first connecting them to Domoticz and later, Home Assistant. There&rsquo;s several ways to use them and I&rsquo;ll explain a couple.</p>
<h1 id="one-wire-with-home-assistant-esphome-and-esp32esp8266-controllers-or-usb">One wire with Home Assistant (ESPHome and ESP32/ESP8266 controllers, or USB)</h1>
<p>This is my absolute favourite way of using these sensors nowadays. I find working with ESPHome a pleasure and the wiring is very simple and forgiving. There are various forms of connectors</p>
<p><em>This guide assumes you have set up ESPHome already and have a microcontroller ready to be written</em></p>
<h2 id="step-1---the-physical-wiring">Step 1 - The physical wiring.</h2>
<p>There are two main type of 1-wire temp sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The DS1820 or DS18S20 bare sensor  <figure><img src="/home-automation/esphome/one-wire/ds1920.jpg"
    alt="DS1820 or DS18S20" width="290px">
</figure>
</li>
<li>The DS18B20 or Waterproof <figure><img src="/home-automation/esphome/one-wire/ds18b20.jpg"
    alt="DS18B20 or Waterproof" width="290px">
</figure>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people will buy the DS18B20 which is easier to assemble and still very cheap.</p>
<h4 id="connections">Connections:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Red wire of DS18B20, Pin 3 (VDD) of DS1820 should be connected to between 3 and 5v.  Both these voltages are typically available on an ESP, but 3.3 is the more commonly used.</li>
<li>Black wire of DS18B20, Pin 1 (GND) of DS1820 1 should be connected to GND on the ESP.</li>
<li>Yellow wire of DS18B20, Pin 2 (DQ) of DS1820, should be connected to the GPIO port you choose on your ESP.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-resistor">The Resistor</h4>
<ul>
<li>A resistor should be placed between the Red and Yellow (Pins 1 and 3 on the DS1820) to &ldquo;Pull up&rdquo; the bus. This should be 4.7k ohms. However, I have tested with various resistors down to 1kohm, and even omitted it entirely and had satisfactory results. But it does seem to work best with 4.7kohms used.</li>
<li>The resistor should be connected as close to the ESP as possible, so it affects the whole bus.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="mermaid align-center ">flowchart TD

    n5 --&gt; n7([&#34;4.7K Ohm Resistor&#34;])
    n4 --&gt; n7</pre>
<h4 id="connecting-multiple-sensors-to-one-bus">Connecting multiple sensors to one bus</h4>
<ul>
<li>References to a &ldquo;Bus&rdquo; in other documentation simply means the wire network this system runs on, especially when there are multiple sensors connected.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is simply done by creating either a single &ldquo;star&rdquo; where multiple sensors are fed from the same connections, or from multiple stars where connections are made from a common backbone wire. In all cases, it is simply a case of connecting all the same wires or pins together. Every red to a red, every black to a black, every yellow to a yellow - until the first connection which goes to the relevant pins on the ESP.</p>
<p>

</p>
<h6 id="notes">Notes:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Either sensor can run at between 3 and 5v dc and the red/pin3 can be connected to either. It does not affect accuracy which is used.</li>
<li>Sensors have a unique ID which is reported along with their readings along the common &ldquo;bus&rdquo; back to the ESP or controller. This ID is how we identify which device is supplying which reading.</li>
<li>It is possible to run large lengths of one-wire with many devices. I personally have run a bus of around 80 feet with 12 sensors connected to it.</li>
<li>One wire can be remarkably resilient on the type of wire it uses. There are recorded cases if people using house pipework.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s reported that longer installations work best with an external 5v power supply, but I have had no problem using an ESP&rsquo;s 3.3v output. The current needed is tiny.</li>
<li>Although it&rsquo;s called one wire, a good installation requires three cores.</li>
<li>That said, it is possible to create a network by connecting only two cores. This is done by connecting the red and yellow wires of the DS18B20 (The outer two, GND and VDD of a DS1820). This can work very reliably and avoids the needs of a resistor, but should only be considered if three core wire is unavailable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-2---ok-so-the-wirings-done-what-about-taking-readings">Step 2 - Ok, so the wiring’s done, what about taking readings?</h2>
<p>There are multiple ways to get the readings into Home Assistant.</p>
<h3 id="esphome">ESPHome</h3>
<p>Assuming you already have an ESP set up and ready to use.</p>
<p>Connect the wiring as above to the ESP (Most GPIO pins can be used for the Signal/DQ/Yellow pin - we&rsquo;ll use GPIO5 for our example below (Pin D1 on a Nodemcu)</p>
<p>Add this to the ESPHome yaml;</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code># GPIO
one_wire:
  - platform: gpio
    pin: GPIO5</code></pre></div>
<p>And run <code>esphome run MyESPFile.yaml</code> and wait until it boots and starts producing logs.</p>
<p>Inside the logs, assuming the physical connection is good, ESPHome will discover all devices on the one-wire bus, like so:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>[20:59:28][C][gpio.one_wire:022]: GPIO 1-wire bus:
[20:59:28][C][gpio.one_wire:023]:   Pin: GPIO14
[20:59:28][C][gpio.one_wire:084]:   Found devices:
[20:59:28][C][gpio.one_wire:086]:     0x9c01145eeabd4028 (DS18B20)
[20:59:28][C][gpio.one_wire:086]:     0xee012026de4a2428 (DS18B20)
[20:59:28][C][gpio.one_wire:086]:     0x0401202706051528 (DS18B20)
[20:59:28][C][captive_portal:089]: Captive Portal:</code></pre></div>
<p>These provide the unique ID of each temperature sensor and the model needed.</p>
<p>Now you have the information you need to re-edit the yaml and create the sensors properly, like so:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>sensor:
  # Dallas
  # Repeat for each sensor on this bus
  - platform: dallas_temp
    address: 0x9c01145eeabd4028
    name: &#34;Boiler Flow&#34;    
    update_interval: 30s
  - platform: dallas_temp
    address: 0xee012026de4a2428
    name: &#34;Hot Water Tank&#34;    
    update_interval: 30s</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="tips">Tips</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The DB18B20 sensor may have the ID printed on its label and you can create the sensor config on your first go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your Dallas bus has several sensors and you&rsquo;re unsure which sensor relates to which purpose, continue streaming logs after building it, and simply hold one in your hand (or mouth, or cup of ice) for a little while until its readings change. Then add a sticky label to its lead.</p>

<p>This can be connected to Home Assistant directly using it&rsquo;s native <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/onewire/" rel="external" target="_blank">1-wire integration</a> or, as I did (because the former wasn&rsquo;t available when I first set up one-wire), by using Linux&rsquo;s OWFS one-wire file system, and writing a script to read the values from the local file system and put them into a MariaDb database, from which HA would fetch the values. (Not a very elegant way, but it worked well for years!)</p>

<h1 id="keeping-zigbee-sensors-running-in-extreme-cold">Keeping Zigbee Sensors Running in Extreme Cold</h1>

<p>The Aqara (and other) Zigbee devices are great in almost every situation. But when using them in cold conditions, such as inside a freezer, the default CR2032 batteries don&rsquo;t last well, especially in subzero temperatures.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s really simple to adapt them to use the much larger and commonly available 18650 Lithium rechargable batteries. I&rsquo;ve had several of these batteries reporting the temperature of my freezer in around -20c for over a year without needing recharging – quite remarkable!</p>
<p>To compare that to a CR2032, which would last just a couple of days for unbranded batteries, and even &ldquo;Cold Formula&rdquo; Ever-Ready batteries would give up the ghost between one week and two months, and you see why this is a modification that&rsquo;s worth making, if just to avoid wasting lots of CR2032 and avoiding the environmental and safety costs associated.</p>
<p>One solution is simply to solder an 18650 battery holder onto the sensor itself. Both being single-cell lithium batteries, the voltages are identical at a nominal 3.2v but the capacity is dramatically different. The 18650 will often read up to 4.2v when freshly charged, but I&rsquo;ve found no issues with connecting that directly to these sensors.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t restricted to Aqara or temperature sensors. Anything that takes a CR2032 or CR2016 or any other 3.2v lithium battery can usually be adapted this way.</p>
<h3 id="things-needed">Things needed:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Zigbee/Zwave/whatever temperature/humidity/other sensor</li>
<li>An 186550 single battery holder (Cost around £1-2, eg, ebay, aliexpress). You can solder directly to the battery if you prefer.</li>
<li>A soldering iron and some solder.</li>
<li>A hot glue gun (optional) or some tape/zip tie/whatever to hold the two things together. The wires and solder connections aren&rsquo;t really strong enough to take any strain.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="process-difficulty-simple">Process (Difficulty: Simple)</h3>
<p>Take your sensor and uncover the battery compartment, removing the CR2032 battery.</p>
<p>

</figure>
</p>
<p>Note the two metal contacts. The little one at the top on the edge is the <strong>POSITIVE</strong> contact. The larger one in the middle is the <strong>NEGATIVE</strong>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re ever unsure about which way these go, use a multi-meter to test the CR2032 battery. The larger surface on these is positive and often marked with a <code>+</code> sign. The smaller, back face is negative.</p>
<p><strong>Now check the battery holder and if necessary strip around 5mm of plastic back from the ends of the red and black wires;</strong></p>
<p>

    <figcaption><p><b><i>Excuse the shadows – there are only two wires here!</b></i></p></figcaption>

</p>
<p>Next, solder the black wire from the battery holder onto the middle contact, and the red to the edge contact.</p>
<p>

</figure>
</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to the electric connections, and now is a good change to test it still works</p>
<p>Fit a battery to the holder and quickly press the button on the sensor. This should result in a blue light. If it doesn&rsquo;t, or you small a burning electrical smell, remove the battery quickly and check which way you&rsquo;ve connected the wires. <em>(I&rsquo;ve done this myself and surprisingly the sensors seem to survive mis-polarity for a short interval)</em></p>
<p>If things look good, you can then try a longer press and hold to ensure it connects to your zigbee network.</p>

</figure>
</p>
<p>If everything is good, then it&rsquo;s time to glue or tape the battery holder and sensor together. I love hot glue, it&rsquo;s messy and hurts when it gets on your skin, but very useful for stuff like this.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m placing these in a freezer, I like to put them in a small ziplock bag to protect them a little from frost condensation. This may not be strictly necessary – these small devices are remarkably robust – but it doesn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve done that, you might want to create an Automation in your Home Assistant or other monitoring program that lets you know when the temperature raises above a certain temperature, say -5c.</p>
<p>Automations like this have notified me when someone&rsquo;s left the freezer door open, or it&rsquo;s been unplugged by accident, and even after several hours of a power cut.</p>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Freezer doors are usually made of steel and of course, this does affect the radio signal of Zigbee. However, in practice, I&rsquo;ve found that the signal still gets through in my environment. Zigbee does benefit from a few mains-powered devices dotted through the home which add as mesh repeaters and perhaps that&rsquo;s helped me out.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alternatively">Alternatively</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When I first did this, I placed the battery outside of the freezer to keep it warm, and ran the thin wires through the door seal. That worked okay, but out of curiousity I tried putting the whole thing inside and found that surprisingly, the battery lasted almost as long as being left outside in the warm. You could even use an external 3v power supply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use other types of temperature sensors. I&rsquo;ve used both one-wire DS18B20 temperature sensors and DHT11/22&rsquo;s by pushing the wire through the door seal.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-home-assistant-is-helping-heat-my-water-for-free-with-help-from-the-sun">How Home Assistant is helping heat my water for free (With help from the sun)</h1>

<p><em>(Free in third party energy costs, anyway)</em></p>
<h2 id="update-after-three-years">Update after three years</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not had to change or maintain <strong>any</strong> of this setup – everything has continued to work perfectly. Through the summer, a typical sunny day charges the 5.4kwh battery by about 11 AM, then heats the water and exports to the grid for another few hours before the hot water&rsquo;s heated. For our house of two, that meant the LPG boiler that normally heats the water stayed off through all of July and August, and most of June and September. Not bad for an investment of £85</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I had Solar panels fitted a month ago. At the time I discussed with the engineer about using excess to heat water, directly from the inverter. But there was no immersion heater fitted to my tank at that time, and the installer wasn&rsquo;t keen on adding that to the job.<em>(And having fitted it myself now, I totally understand why, fitting the element was a tank-out pig of a job that took most of a day)</em></p>
<p>But once the solar panels were fitted and generating power, I wasn’t entirely happy to see the excess being pushed back into the grid for nothing. (After much setting up and back and forth, I did start to be paid 5p per kwh, but as I pay them 33p for the same, I don&rsquo;t consider this a <em>great</em> deal)</p>
<p>Anyway, I scratched my head and came up with this system.</p>
<h2 id="items">Items:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Inverter and Battery and GivEnergy systems are integrated into my HA setup thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cdpuk/givenergy-local" rel="external" target="_blank">cdpuk&rsquo;s integration 11</a>, which works perfectly. This allows me to get all the stats I need into HA, and display them like this:</li>
</ul>

<li>A low power 1kw 27″ top-mounted immersion element. Normal immersions are 3kw, which is more than I can generate to excess. 1kw is perfect for me. I fitted this to the tank (fiddly) and connected it to a 13a capable flex which connected to a standard UK 13a fused plug.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<li>A TPLink MiniKasa smart socket. (wifi) The socket is rated for 13a and by choosing a low power immersion (they’re normally 3kw for fixed wiring) I’m keeping load on that around 5a at 230vac, and the switch is not getting warm. I would be more concerned about load with an unbranded or low quality switch. But even in a warm room, this is fine.</li>

<li>£5 for ancillaries (socket, wiring, sensor, tea)</li>
<li>£7,700 for the solar install <em>(ahem)</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="controlling-things">Controlling things</h2>
<p>This just needs two very simple automations</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the solar system is sending &gt;1200 watts to the grid for more than 5 minutes and the temperature of the tank is &lt;60c:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn <strong>on</strong> socket feeding the immersion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If sending &lt;1000w to the grid for more than 3 minutes <strong>or</strong> temp &gt;65c:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn <strong>off</strong> socket feeding the immersion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="safety">Safety:</h2>
<p>Some things to consider if you fancy doing something similar.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is a traditional UK Y-Plan <strong>vented</strong> hot water system. It&rsquo;s fed by an unpressurised cold water tank in the loft, so there is little risk of explosion should the water get too hot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My tank didn&rsquo;t have space to insert the heating element in-situ, so I needed to drain and remove it. Even then, the top nut was very stiff and difficult to remove.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be competent at mains wiring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose an immersion element with dual thermostats. One of these should be set by the factory, the second is where you set the target temperature. Once either is reached, it will cut power into the element regardless of the switch. This system is independent of HA and any automation - that&rsquo;s important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build in as many safeguards as you can. For example, I have a tertiary automation that turns off the switch if it happens to be on at sunset, when there&rsquo;s no chance of any more free power. This is a safety precaution, but also a cost one. Electricity from the mains is expensive - I don&rsquo;t want that to be heating my water by accident!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s working great. The water gets hotter</p>
<h2 id="result">Result</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s working great. The system satisfies my house hot water needs entirely on any sunny day (in Winter too). My LPG boiler doesn&rsquo;t get used in the summer, although it&rsquo;s still connected and will step in if the water drops too low during its own schedule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to estimate the cost saving, but it certainly repays the investment several times a year.  (That&rsquo;s this project, not the whole solar install!)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.traccar.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">Traccar</a> is an amazing piece of free, open source software to track GPS devices and people.</p>
<p>However, I had trouble getting accurate results through its Traccar Client Android app – it would report positions miles away from where I was, and a journey was logged with very strange results indeed. However, GPSLogger already running on the same device was extremely accurate.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I&rsquo;ve since learned that changing Traccar&rsquo;s client to &lsquo;High Sensitivity&rsquo; does fix most of the inaccuracies, but I still preferred GPSLogger which could also record a local GPX and upload to Gdrive at the same time</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I decided to use GPSLogger&rsquo;s Custom URL feature to use that to update Traccar, and skip using the dedicated client entirely. This also meant one less app running on my phone, as I use GPSLogger to automatically create GPX files of my journeys.</p>
<p>So – how to use GPSLogger to report your position to your own Traccar server. I found this to be very accurate and well behaved.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.traccar.org/osmand/" rel="external" target="_blank">Traccar documentation for OSMAN type URL paramaters</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gpslogger.app/images/17b.png" rel="external" target="_blank">GPSLogger&rsquo;s parameter reference (Parent)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps">Steps:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Have a publically accessible URL for your Traccar server.
<em>I host Traccar on my private server behind a CGNat, and use a free Cloudflare tunnel to allow remote access to it.
Eg: <code>https://tracserver.domain.com</code></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install GPSLogger onto your phone
Note: It&rsquo;s not on play.com, so you&rsquo;ll need to use <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.mendhak.gpslogger/" rel="external" target="_blank">FDroid</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mendhak/gpslogger/" rel="external" target="_blank">install manually via APK</a> – see the <a href="https://gpslogger.app/" rel="external" target="_blank">GPSLogger site</a> for details</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In GPSLogger, Set your Logging Details up as you want and then navigate to <code>Auto Send, email and upload</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section should be left unset for Traccar, but if you&rsquo;re also sending a GPX file to GDrive or elsewhere, you may already have settings here. Just ensure <code>Custom URL</code> in this section is NOT ticked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return to the GPSLogger setting menu and select <code>Custom URL</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tick <code>Log to custom URL</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UNTICK <code>Allow Auto Sending</code> (otherwise it will repeatedly send the same coords to traccar until it floods out a few hours later)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also leave <code>Discard offline locations</code> unticked. This way if your connection fails, GPSlogger will keep recording and send those logs to Traccar once network is restored, so you can a decent history log even offline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <code>URL</code>, put the following, but change</p>
<p>a) <strong>TRACCAR_URL</strong> to your public URL. If you have a specific port you need to use, specify that after the URL and BEFORE the following slash. Eg: <code>…COM:5505/</code></p>
<p>b) The <strong>ID</strong> to match the ID of your user in Traccar. (Change YOUR_ID to that number)</p>
<p><code>https://TRACCAR_URL/?id=YOUR_ID&amp;lat=%LAT&amp;lon=%LON&amp;hdop=1&amp;altitude=%ALT&amp;speed=%SPD&amp;batt=%BATT&amp;timestamp=%TIMESTAMP&amp;charge=%ISCHARGING&amp;bearing=%DIR</code></p>
<p>You can play around with the parameters as per the references above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Important! Under <code>HTTP Method</code>, set this from <code>GET</code> to <code>POST</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back out and click <code>Start Logging</code>. If everything is good, then you should see GPSLogger issuing http requests in its Logging page. Soon after, you&rsquo;ll see your device start to update on the Traccar map.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>GPSLogger shows a small blue circle at the top right of its menu when it&rsquo;s sending and the device should be updated a few seconds after that, at whatever upload frequency you set.</li>
<li>You can also watch the logs in Traccar on the server by doing something like: <code>tail -f /opt/traccar/logs/tracker-server.log</code></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="measuring-freezer-temperatures">Measuring Freezer Temperatures</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="/home-automation/zigbee-sensors-in-the-cold/index.html">Please also read my article about keeping Zigbee and other battery devices running in sub-zero temperatures</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Or dealing with battery failure in minus twenty degrees.</em></p>
<p>Some years ago, I filled one of my freezers with frozen meat for my dogs and forgot to turn it on. My dogs helpfully reminded me three weeks later when it started oozing liquid out through the door. Finding a home for 80kg of rotted meat in open plastic bags was one of the less fun jobs I’ve had, and trying to prevent this happening again drove me to start monitoring their temperatures.</p>
<p>I currently use two methods to measure these temperatures, and have an Automation that alerts me whenever one of the temperatures goes above -5c. This should alert me if I’ve forgotten to turn it on again, as well as freezer failure or someone leaving the door open. With the average cost of a freezer’s contents being over £100, it seems like a sensible thing to do and over the years has alerted us to several non-closed doors.</p>
<h1 id="method-1-onewire">Method 1: Onewire</h1>
<p>One method I use is to add a Onewire sensor inside a freezer by poking a small hole in the door seal by the hinges and shoving a waterproof DS18B20 sensor inside – like this:</p>
<p>

</ul>
<h2 id="cons">Cons:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The need to poke a hole in the door seal.<em>(If you have some flat wire, you can avoid this by just closing the seal over it)</em></li>
<li>Fixed wiring. This might be unsightly and time consuming to fit. I’ve used it where I had an existing Onewire run nearby.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="method-2-zigbee-temperature-sensors">Method 2: Zigbee Temperature Sensors</h1>
<p>Wireless temperature sensors like the Aqara are cheap, reasonably accurate and small. If you have Zigbee already, then I would suggest using these.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>These use CR2032 button batteries. In normal, room-temperature, situations these last for up to a year. However, in a freezer at -20, I’ve had good, branded batteries fail after 3 days!</p>
<p>To overcome this, I’ve modified my sensors to use 18650 rechargable batteries by connecting wires to the battery compartment in the Aqara that go to a battery holder. That can be in the freezer with the sensor, making a very portable little unit – or, with longer wires, outside of the freezer to stay warmer.</p>
<p>

<p>Whilst the room-temperature version should last longer, in practice I have found little difference in lifespan. Both last at least six months before needing recharging.</p>

<p>Incidentally, it’s no big surprise that range is affected in these low-power sensors by putting them inside a big metal box! However, they still reach across my house to my Slae.sh Zigbee usb stick and reliability has been excellent.</p>
<h2 id="pros-1">Pros:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Neater and quicker to install.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cons-1">Cons:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Less regular updates – these sensors only send a reading when the temperature changes. However, in practice this is a non-problem since the freezer is always cycling and updates are adequate.</li>
<li>Still a need to replace batteries.</li>
<li>Potential range issues when inside a freezer.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="alerting-to-a-problem">Alerting to a problem</h1>
<p>Below is my automation in Home Assistant.</p>
<p>If any of my five sensors go above -5c, then send myself a message over Telegram and run a Shell command (This plays a .wav file to a speaker that tells the house that a freezer is over temperature)</p>

<h1 id="cool-automation-projects">Cool Automation Projects</h1>

<p>Just some cool ideas for automation if you&rsquo;re looking for inspiration, or justifying why Home Automation can be useful.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-night-lights">Automatic Night Lights</h2>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Like many people into their middle age, I sometimes need to visit the toilet at night. Turning on lights and remembering to turn them off wasn&rsquo;t the biggest deal in the world, but I thought it woke my brain up just a little bit more than it needed.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Create a system that detects movement and turns on lights to the most common areas.</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>In Home Assistant:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using various existing movement sensors (From the original Burglar Alarm, combined with a couple of Aqara Zigbee PIR sensors, and all the door sensors; detect movement</li>
<li>If the time is between Sunset and Sunrise, turn on some lights. Wait five minutes and then turn them back off. If more movement is detected, reset the timer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Even Better:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The automations work by time. After 10PM when we&rsquo;re more likely to be going to bed, the same automation applies but only sets the lights at 5%. This is just bright enough to see by.</li>
<li>These are better than standalone &ldquo;movement lights&rdquo; because:
<ul>
<li>They never run out of battery.</li>
<li>They can be linked in many creative ways depending where that movement is detected. For example: Front door opens? We probably want most lights on. But if it&rsquo;s bedroom movement at night, chances are it&rsquo;s just the hall and bathroom that are needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="monitoring-freezer-temperatures">Monitoring Freezer Temperatures</h2>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> What happens if a freezer is unplugged or breaks down when it&rsquo;s full of food, and you don&rsquo;t notice it immediately?</p>
<p><strong>History:</strong> We used to feed our dogs on a raw meat diet. That meant buying a lot of meat, all packages in 500g plastic bags and kept in a half-sized freezer in the house. It was actually the overflow dog food freezer so had been left turned off before hand. We had a delivery that filled the primary freezer so I put the overflow in this one. 30kg of raw meat. What I didn&rsquo;t do, was turn the freezer back on&hellip;  A fortnight later, we noticed the dogs were sniffing at the freezer and licking it, and when I opened it, rotting meat fell out. Cleaning that up was not a fun game&hellip; (Fortunately we had a farmer friend who was able to dispose of the meat, but we still had to remove and bag it up to get it outside, then do a big cleanup job. Quite an incentive to prevent it re-occurring, right?</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Monitor the internal temperature of each freezer (We had five at one point) and raise alerts if any of them went above -5&rsquo;c</p>

<p><em>Cooling servers using household plumbing</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;How to water cool computers using household plumbing equipment&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>I like peace and quiet. Most water cooling rigs available for home PCs are anything but – they only use water to move the heat away from the CPU and GPU to a finned radiator, then blast it with fans. I thought that radiant cooling would work and not need any fans, so I built a water cooling system. It worked perfectly for a linux server and my gaming windows PC for three years, until I had to free up space and instead focussed on sound proofing a cupboard and using air cooling. This was back in 2010 but there&rsquo;s no reason why it wouldn&rsquo;t work today.</p>

<p>This shows the initial plan of using a 22mm to 10mm 4-way adapter. In practice, my piping leaked here, so I used a flow and return circuit of 22mm copper, reducing to 15mm and then onto flexible pipe</p>

</p>
<p>I had most of this lying around after fixing various household heating problems. All standard UK wet central heating equipment.</p>
<p>The only non-standard bit were the CPU and GPU water heatsinks. They cost around £10 each, second hand from ebay.</p>
<p>Total additional cost was about £95 – this was for the radiator, pipe and the heatsinks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The pump is a standard UK central heating pump. These are ceramic and designed to run 24/7 pumping water up to 80&rsquo;c and use around 25 watts at speed setting 1 of 3.</li>
<li>The radiator is a small standard single pane radiator. This barely ran above room temperature (whgich is 15-30c), so oversized was it. It could have coped with at least six CPUs and GPUs. Bear in mind that all the piping is also radiating away heat, so by the time it gets to the rad it&rsquo;s already dropped a few degrees.</li>

    <figcaption><p><b><i>Putting things together where a small leak doesn&rsquo;t matter</b></i></p></figcaption>
  
</figure>
</p>
<p>To explain this: The black plastic tank is the &ldquo;header&rdquo;, containing water to fill the white pipe and allows and air in the system to vent. Fresh tap water contains a surprising amount of air which takes time to settle out. This tank needn&rsquo;t be as big as this – but I had this spare.</p>
<p>Then water flows <strong>IN</strong> to the red central heating pump. Having the air vent before this allows much of the air to escape before hitting the pump. This causes about the only noise this system creates and lowers efficiency of the pumping, since the bubbles act as little pressure-absorbers. Handbooks will tell you about cavitation risk here, which might damage the impeller as well as creating noise, but I consider this risk very small given the speed and low temperature of this water. But it&rsquo;s still good to avoid anyway.</p>
<p>After the pump, the water would go to the &ldquo;Cold&rdquo; side of the 15mm copper manifold (not shown here), and after passing through the heatsinks, would go ito the &ldquo;Hot&rdquo; manifold which then led to the Radiator.</p>
<p>Both inlet and outlet of this rad is on the bottom, so some air will collect at the top and can be bled away with a normal radiator key. (Once running for a while, the water loses its air content and no further bleeding will be needed until you introduce fresh water – just like a wet central heating system)</p>
<p>

<p>This shows one of the heat sinks being tested for pressure and stepping down in pipe sizes. Note the metal sleeves inside the joint – this worked well as the pressure really is very small. Warming up the pipe ends in a cup of hot water allowed them to soften enough to form a snug fit.</p>

<p>This is my linux server running very naked. You can see the flexible pipe coming into the cpu block. The hdd&rsquo;s are on elastic to reduce vibration noise. I still run naked machines nowadays, even with cpu fans, as I have a nice soundproof place to put them. Cases aren&rsquo;t needed if you can limit physical access, and this removes the need for a case fan entirely, as non-hotspot sources of heat radiate upwards naturally.</p>

<p>This was my windows PC, a gaming computer. Here the Cold supply comes into the blue CPU heatsink and then leaves to feed the GPU heatsink before returning to the Cold manifold. My view was that it&rsquo;s more important to cool the cpu first, but in reality the flow was enough so that it didn&rsquo;t really matter. The GPU didn&rsquo;t run much hotter than the CPU.</p>

<p>And some test results. This was a 2-core CPU running &lsquo;stress&rsquo; to give some load, and as you can see the cpu temps are barely above ambient. I don&rsquo;t think this machine ever went above 30&rsquo;c cpu temp during the several years of this operation. <em>This machine would normally run at 50-60c when aircooled</em></p>
<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>I enjoyed this project and the benefits it brought for several years. The pump never failed and was almost silent in operation (except for air bubbles and the very faintest hum). I never had a leak nor had any failures whatsoever, but obviously that is a risk with any wet system. The biggest noise was the PSU fan, but with 120mm fans and choosing &lsquo;quiet&rsquo; models I deemed it acceptable.</p>
<p>Eventually I upgraded the GPU on my gaming PC and I couldn&rsquo;t find a compatible water block for it (remember this was before water cooling was as popular as it is now) and so I regretfully removed the kit. I replaced the linux server with an HP ML110 which went in an outbuilding, so that was no longer a noise source.</p>
<p>I still run my desktop in this cupboard without a case, finding it runs cooler than being in a metal box. There&rsquo;s now a 120mm fan fixed to the wall exhausting warm air to the outside, and the doors are lined with soft foam and thus the noise issue has been solved in a another way. My actual desk is on the other side of the room, with 5m extension leads to a USB hub and the monitors.</p>

<h1 id="using-gpslogger-with-traccar">Using Gpslogger With Traccar</h1>

<p><em>Making two excellent pieces of free software talk to each other</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.traccar.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">Traccar</a> is an amazing piece of free, open source software to track GPS devices and people.</li>
<li><a href="https://gpslogger.app/" rel="external" target="_blank">GPSLogger</a> is an amazing piece of free software that records GPS tracks on Android very well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if you could use GPSLogger to send your position to Traccar? Well, you can, and it&rsquo;s not hard.</p>
<h4 id="why-not-just-use-traccars-android-client">Why not just use Traccar&rsquo;s Android client?</h4>
<p>A good question, and there&rsquo;s no reason why not. It (usually) works fine. however, I did have a few issues with it that, whilsts not serious, were enough to steer me towards GPSlogger.</p>
<ul>
<li>GPSLogger has more settings for granularity, and those are well documented.</li>
<li>One of the devices I was using kept on turning off Traccar-Client and nothing I tried would keep it running for more than an hour.</li>
<li>I found GPSLogger was better at dropping GPS Jitter reports from the devices.</li>
<li>GPSLogger used less battery for me.</li>
<li>Traccar has huge support for a great many devices and software. Whilst it doesn&rsquo;t support GPSLogger natively, it does provide a simple webhook for OSMand which is easily used.</li>
<li>And - critically - I was already using GPSLogger to record GPS tracks whenever I walked or biked somewhere.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Please don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m criticising Traccar or Traccar-Client - I&rsquo;m sure it works great for many people and I love the project</em></p>
<p>And one reason not to use GPSLogger: It&rsquo;s no longer published via Google&rsquo;s Play store. So you will need to visit the <a href="https://gpslogger.app/" rel="external" target="_blank">website</a> and download the APK to install it. Some people are understandably nervous about doing this, and some phones won&rsquo;t let you do so without a lot of fiddling. Fair enough, and Traccar Client is on Play store.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-get-gpslogger-reporting-your-position-to-traccar">How to get GPSLogger reporting your position to Traccar</h4>
<p>*I&rsquo;ve been using this method for almost a year with a very good success)</p>
<p><em>References:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.traccar.org/osmand/" rel="external" target="_blank">Traccar documentation for OSMAN type URL paramaters</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gpslogger.app/images/17b.png" rel="external" target="_blank">GPSLogger&rsquo;s parameter reference </a> <a href="https://gpslogger.app/#morescreenshots" rel="external" target="_blank">(Parent)</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h4>
<p>Go to your Traccar website, into <code>Settings</code> then <code>Devices</code> and make a note of the <code>Identifier</code> number for the device you&rsquo;re configuring. This is your <code>USER-ID</code> and you&rsquo;ll need it later.</p>
<p><em>If you haven&rsquo;t set up a new Device in Traccar yet, please do so first</em></p>
<p><em>Steps:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Have a publically accessible URL for your Traccar server.
<em>I host Traccar on my private server behind a CGNat, and use a free Cloudflare tunnel to allow remote access to it. Eg: <code>https://tracserver.domain.com</code></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install GPSLogger onto your phone  <a href="https://gpslogger.app/" rel="external" target="_blank">Website</a>
*You can either use FDroid, which also keeps it up to date, or just install the latest APK from the <a href="/misc/using-gpslogger-with-traccar/index.html">GPSLogger website</a></p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> GPSLogger is not on Google&rsquo;s Play store, so you&rsquo;ll need to use FDroid or install manually via APK – see the <a href="https://gpslogger.app/" rel="external" target="_blank">GPSLogger site</a> for details</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In GPSLogger, tap the 3-line menu top-left to enter settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set your <strong>Logging Details</strong> up as you want and then navigate to <code>Auto Send, email and upload</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This section should be left unset for Traccar, but if you’re also sending a GPX file to GDrive or elsewhere, you may already have settings here. Just ensure “Custom URL” in this section is <em>NOT ticked</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Return to the GPSLogger settings menu and select <code>Custom URL</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tick <code>Log to custom URL</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UNTICK</strong> <code>Allow Auto Sending</code>  <em>(Otherwise it will repeatedly send the same coords to Traccar until it floods out a few hours later)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also leave <code>Discard offline locations</code> <em>unticked</em>. This way if your connection fails, GPSlogger will keep recording and send those logs to Traccar once network is restored, so you can a decent history log even offline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <code>URL</code>, put the following, but change two items</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>TRACCAR_URL</strong> to the public URL of your Traccar server. If you have a specific port you need to use, specify that after the URL and BEFORE the following slash. Eg: <code>https://my-traccar-server-mydomain.com:5505/</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>USER-ID</strong> for your device, as noted earlier. <em>(Change YOUR_ID to that number)</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>https://TRACCAR_URL/?id=YOUR_ID&amp;lat=%LAT&amp;lon=%LON&amp;hdop=1&amp;altitude=%ALT&amp;speed=%SPD&amp;batt=%BATT&amp;timestamp=%TIMESTAMP&amp;charge=%ISCHARGING&amp;bearing=%DIR</code></pre></div>
<p><em>I find it easiest to copy and paste these to my email client to get them on the phone, then copy and paste into GPSLogger. You can play around with the parameters as per the Parameter guide on GPSLogger and Traccar&rsquo;s sites to change what it sends above, but these are quite comprehensive.</em></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p><strong>Important!</strong> Under <code>HTTP Method</code> in GPSLogger&rsquo;s Custom URL settings page, <strong>change</strong> this from <code>GET</code> to <code>POST</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back out of the menus and click <code>Start Logging</code> in GPSLogger&rsquo;s main page. If everything is good, then you should see your device start to update on the page.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="notes-and-problems">Notes and Problems</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GPSLogger shows a small blue circle at the top right of its menu when it’s sending and the device should be updated a few seconds after that, at whatever upload frequency you set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opening GPSLogger&rsquo;s <code>Log View</code> page will show you what it&rsquo;s doing. If you see any red lines, something broke. Green lines denote a successful send of coordinates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traccar&rsquo;s logs are quite useful in debugging any problems - <code>tail -f /opt/traccar/logs/tracker-server.log</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fine-tuning-things">Fine Tuning Things</h4>
<p>In GPSLogger&rsquo;s Settings menu, under <code>Performance</code> you can make a big difference to battery usage by tuning a few items. These are my suggestions;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Logging interval</strong> <em>(How often GPSLogger sends coordinates to Traccar)</em> - No less than 10 seconds. 30-60 is a more normal balance for good battery life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Distance filter</strong> <em>(If GPSLogger detects you&rsquo;ve moved less than this distance since it last sent your location to Traccar, it won&rsquo;t send this time - very useful to save it sending pointless updates and wearing down the battery, and it explains that in the Log View.)</em>  I use <code>4 meters</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accuracy filter</strong> <em>(If GPSLogger has a weak GPS signal that gives a certainty less than this value, it won&rsquo;t send a reading to Traccar this time)</em>  I set this to <code>50meters</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Duration to match accuracy)</strong> <em>(How long it takes to get a GPS reading should take less than this)</em> I set this to <code>10 seconds</code> as a good balance to save using too much battery trying to get a fix in a poor signal area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Options ON: <code>Log GPS/GNSS Locations</code>, <code>Choose best accuracy in duration</code>.  Every other option left off, apart from those mentioned.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s it!  GPSLogger should be sending your device&rsquo;s position every <code>Logging interval</code> seconds with a reasonably balance of accuracy and battery life.</p>

<h1 id="docker-network-fails-after-iptables-restarts">Docker Network Fails After Iptables Restarts</h1>

<p>For almost a decade, Docker users have been complaining about a specific problem using Docker. This has affected us quite a lot, including taking around 40 docker servers running hundreds of services offline recently when I ran a script that added a local firewall rule.</p>
<p>The issue is that when Docker starts, it adds whatever rules it needs to talk to the world to the local firewall service. That’s often iptables, but also nftables and probably others. Those rules are temporary and not saved in the firewall’s configuration.</p>
<p>If the firewall is restarted for any reason (such as a sysadmin adding a new port) then those temporary rules are lost by the firewall and Docker can no longer talk to the outside world. Alerts start flashing, people get unhappy – you’ve just lost points in the game of sysadminning.</p>
<p>I researching this problem, and found that Docker’s devs take the firm view that “It’s not Docker’s problem”. I can actually understand that. If other parts of the OS went away, would we expect services to continue running? Some people clearly do – and other software checks basic network continuity and will automatically heal if something like this happens. (Several examples given <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/12294" rel="external" target="_blank">in the Github thread</a> )</p>
<p>But – Docker is Docker and does what Docker does. We needed a workaround or it was only a matter of time before someone (probably me) forgot to restart docker after touching the firewall and broke things again.</p>
<p>My boss came up with what I think is an elegant solution to this ugly problem, using systemd’s <code>[Unit]</code> syntaxes.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a new text file, let’s call it <code>/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/restart-docker-if-firewall-breaks.conf</code></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> <em>.conf files in this directory will be added to Docker’s main .service unit file by systemd, but will both be given a higher priority in case of conflict with that, and persist during updates. Docker’s main service file can be overwritten during normal updates.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That file should contain this text:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>[Unit]
After=iptables.service
Requires=iptables.service
PartOf=iptables.service</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Replace iptables with nftables if that is your local firewall (Debian, Rocky9 etc)</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><code>After</code> = <em>Ensures that the listed unit is fully started up before the configured unit is started</em>
<code>Requires</code> = <em>If this unit gets activated, the units listed will be activated as well</em>
<code>PartOf</code> = <em>When systemd stops or restarts the units listed here, the action is propagated to this unit</em></p>
<p>In short, don’t run until iptables is already up, and if that restarts, restart docker.
<strong>Reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.unit.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Systemd documentation</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly, we need to tell systemd about the change with <code>systemctl daemon-reload</code>
We don’t need to restart the Docker service for this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing (Optional)</p>
<p>To test this works, restart iptables: <code>systemctl restart iptables</code></p>
<p>Then check docker’s service status and you should see it’s restarted recently too. <code>systemctl status docker</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it! You can walk away and know that if the local firewall is restarted, instead of docker breaking completely, it will restart and repopulate the firewall with its own temporary rules. You might lose connection to those services briefly, but it will auto-heal.</p>

<h1 id="finding-user-defines">Finding User Defines</h1>

<h3 id="finding-out-if-a-user-has-any-defines">Finding out if a user has any defines**</h3>
<p>Before DROPping an sql user, it&rsquo;s sensible to check whether they have ever created any VIEWs, added a TRIGGER or written a stored PROCEDURE. If you don&rsquo;t, and they did, then deleting the user will result in errors such as <code>MySQL error 1449: The user specified as a definer does not exist</code></p>
<h3 id="why-does-this-happen">Why does this happen?</h3>
<p>MariaDb / MySql uses the definer&rsquo;s permissions to check whether they have authorisation to use that VIEW (which may select from multiple tables), run that STORED PROCEDURE (which may INSERT or DELETE from a table) or run a TRIGGER (again, it may need read/write privs anywhere). It&rsquo;s not a bad system and works well, but doesn&rsquo;t protect itself when that user disappears.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-check-whether-its-safe-to-drop-the-user">How to check whether it&rsquo;s safe to DROP the user?</h3>
<p>Fortunately, this information is stored in the meta database, <code>INFORMATION_SCHEMA</code>, so we can run a query to search it for a given user. Change USERNAME in this for the user you want to check (leaving the % wildcard at the end) and run it. If it returns results, then you will need to reconsider DROPping this user. (GUI tools will let you recreate the PROCEDURE etc, but beware that they usally DROP the routine before recreating it. Fine – except that <strong>any grants given specifically to that VIEW/PROCEDURE/TRIGGER will be automatically removed from any users that have them.</strong></p>

<h1 id="3-quick-ways-to-improve-mariadb-memory-handling">3 Quick Ways to Improve Mariadb Memory Handling</h1>

<p>Something that can surprise users of MariaDb is that it <em>can</em> use a lot more memory than it’s configured for. When I first encountered this I brushed it aside somewhat, thinking this was another example of a software memory leak, but it is controllable with three basic steps that MariaDb recommend and it&rsquo;s worth spending a short amount of time making these changes.</p>
<p>These changes are intended for servers where MariaDb is the primary application. They may not suit performance for multi-role servers where Maria is a small part.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ensure the host has swappiness turned right down.</strong></p>
<p>MariaDb recommend this is set to 1 and we’ve found that works well. This mostly helps performance rather than memory, but it’s so basic I thought it worth including here</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Here’s <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/configuring-swappiness/" rel="external" target="_blank">MariaDb’s reference piece</a> showing how to do this.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>Ensure the host has Transparent Huge Pages disabled.</strong></p>
<p>For us, this made maria’s memory requirements a lot more stable. The gradual increase in memory used we’d seen was entirely gone.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/transparent-huge-pages/" rel="external" target="_blank">MariaDb’s guide on disabling THPs</a></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>Use a more suitable memory manager than most distros ship with.</strong></p>
<p>Most distros ship with a memory allocation library that has to compromise to suit a wide range of uses. MariaDb, like other databases, uses memory quite aggressively in that it&rsquo;s constantly changing what&rsquo;s stored. Fortunately there&rsquo;s at least two more suitable libraries freely available to use.</p>
<p>We use jemalloc most commonly, but also had some success with tcmalloc. Both ship with Rocky Linux and Debian and are quick and easy to install and then enable via systemd.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/using-mariadb-with-tcmalloc-or-jemalloc/" rel="external" target="_blank">MariaDb’s guide to using tcmalloc or jemalloc</a></li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve also written about this in <a href="/p/solving-excess-memory-usage-in-mariadb/">another post here</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All of these changes are part of our basic <strong>New Database Server</strong> build profile now and we’ve been using them for a long time. We no longer over-commit on memory to ensure stability, as the usages can be controlled via MariaDb’s configuration settings (notably innodb_buffer_pool_size ) and monitoring shows some nicely flat memory graphs after they&rsquo;ve initially populated.</p>

<h1 id="solving-excess-memory-usage-in-mariadb">Solving Excess Memory Usage in Mariadb</h1>

<p>Users of MariaDb sometimes notice that the memory used by the process far exceeds what MariaDb is configured to use through its various configuration parameters and buffers. This is especially noticed in larger and busier database servers.</p>
<p>Often, despite looking like a memory leak in the application, this is actually a problem of fragmented memory not being aggressively cleaned by the malloc (memory allocation) library used.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it is a fairly easy thing to solve by installing one of two freely available libraries, jemalloc or tcmalloc, and telling mariadb to use it instead of the OS’s default. These more tightly monitor and defragmented memory pages.</p>
<h2 id="real-life-scenario">Real life scenario</h2>
<p>A company with a number of MariaDb servers running on Centos 7 and 8 often saw memory usage increasing beyond what it should have until oomkiller was activated which killed MariaDb as the biggest memory usage on the server. MariaDb restarted and all was well again until it happened again, some days later. Increasing memory on the server just delayed the inevitable – MariaDb would appear to keep using more and more memory until there was nothing left. They switched to jemalloc and the problem simply went away with no ill effects. Performance was unchanged and they made it a part of their standard database server build.</p>
<h2 id="jemalloc-or-tcmalloc">Jemalloc or TCMalloc?</h2>
<p>I’ve used jemalloc personally with a great amount of success. In all but one extremely busy server, it has completely solved the “memory leakage” effect. In that remaining server – which jemalloc did slow down the rate of growth, I’m planning to trial tcmalloc which has been performing well on a test machine for some months, and others have reported success with tcmalloc where jemalloc wasn’t much help.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-this-needed">Why is this needed?</h2>
<p>Not all memory management operates in the same way, and as there are different needs for a database than a GUI or general use application on a computer, so there are different libraries that prioritise in different way. The two libraries we’re looking at are more aggressive at defragmenting memory pages in particular, which is one reason that leads to memory getting used up.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.managedserver.eu/Improve-mysql-and-mariadb-performance-with-memory-allocators-like-jemalloc-and-tcmalloc" rel="external" target="_blank">ManagedServer has a good explanation with more detailed information here</a></p>
<h2 id="steps-to-enable-jemalloc-for-mariadb">Steps to enable jemalloc for MariaDb</h2>
<ol>
<li>Install the jemalloc library</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In EL (Rocky) distros, that may look something like</p>
<p><code>yum install jemalloc</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Debian and alike, that may be:</p>
<p><code>apt install libjemalloc2</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Locate the actual library file</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In EL, this is currently <code>/usr/lib64/libjemalloc.so.2</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Debian, this is currently <code>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjemalloc.so.2</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>(If you can&rsquo;t find it, you could use <code>mlocate</code> with <code>updatedb&amp;&amp;locate libjemalloc</code> to find it)</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Create a drop-in systemd file for mariadb with an Environment statement to tell MariaDb it needs to load the library. Create a new text file called this containing two lines as below. Change the path to the library file after &lsquo;Environment=&rsquo; to match the above.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>/etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/mariadb_tcmalloc.conf</code></li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>[Service]
Environment=&#39;LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libjemalloc.so.2&#39;</code></pre></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Tell systemd to scan for that file, and then restart MariaDb</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart mariadb</code></pre></div>
<p>And that should be it!</p>
<h2 id="steps-to-enable-tcmalloc-for-mariadb">Steps to enable TCMalloc for MariaDb</h2>
<p>The process is almost identical as for jemalloc, just change the package and library to tcmalloc.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>For Debian, the package to install is currently libtcmalloc-minimal4 and that puts the library file at <code>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtcmalloc_minimal.so.4</code></em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="verifying-it-worked">Verifying it worked</h2>
<p>To see which malloc library MariaDb is using, just run the following SQL query in MariaDb:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE &#39;version_malloc_library&#39;;</code></pre></div>
<p>This should report something useful like, for TCMalloc;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>version_malloc_library tcmalloc gperftools 2.10</p></blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. MariaDb is now running a more suitable alloc library!</p>

<h1 id="zabbix---how-to-monitor-ssl-website-certificates">Zabbix - How to monitor SSL Website Certificates</h1>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong> You want to use Zabbix to monitor your Website’s SSL certificates and be alerted when they’re about to expire.</p>
<p><em>(Note: This method does not work for hosts where you wish to monitor multiple SSH certificates – you will need to have either multiple Hosts, or use a third party template for Multiple Certificates that has a macro format of “CERT.WEBSITE.HOSTNAMEX“ where X is 1-10)</em></p>
<p><strong>The answer:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Edit the existing Host for the server your website is running on. (If it doesn’t exist, create one by going to Monitoring -&gt; Hosts and click the “Create host” button in the top-right:</li>
</ol>
<p>

</figure>
</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Ensure you’re using “Zabbix Agent 2” as an interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the <code>Website certificate by Zabbix agent 2</code> template</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>

</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Click on the <code>Macros</code> tab and then <code>Inherited and Host Macros</code> – you will see there are some new ones that are related, like so:</li>

<li>We’ll obviously need to change at least one of these – at least <code>{$CERT.WEBSITE.HOSTNAME}</code></li>
</ol>
<p>(<code>{$CERT.WEBSITE.IP}</code> shouldn’t actually be needed as well) but we can’t edit them here as they’re global. So click <code>Change</code> to the right of those two, plus any others you may want to edit, such as the warning interval. This copies the Macros from <code>Inherited and host macros</code> across to <code>Host Macros</code> which makes them unique for this Host.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>Click <code>Add</code> to add this host, or <code>Update</code> if it already existed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That’s it! Zabbix will check these certs and alert you <code>{$CERT.EXPIRY.WARN}</code> days before they expire. As ever with Zabbix, if you need to change anything about the alert, then you can click <code>Triggers</code> for the Host and search the Name field for <code>Cert</code> and you’ll find a trigger for <code>SSL Certificate expires soon</code> which can be edited.</p>

<h1 id="migrating-from-prtg-to-zabbix--one-teams-journey">Migrating from PRTG to Zabbix – one team’s journey.</h1>

<p>We turned off PRTG this week after migrating to Zabbix. Here’s what we learned along the way.</p>
<p><em>(These are the personal views and findings of a sysadmin tasked with finding something to replace PRTG as our main monitoring system. They do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer.)</em></p>
<p>We’re a tech based SME with some 500 vm and physical servers. Some linux, some windows, plus the usual assortment of network and edge case devices. Nothing particularly unusual about us.</p>
<p>We first started using PRTG some seven or so years ago. At the time it was the best choice by far, and we thought the licence costs reasonable. It’s been a faithful servant in that time, and we consider it a critical system, especially when our other critical systems had failure. We liked the ability to run user scripts, and got used to the sometimes strange UI and all of our team were, by and large, able to use it well.</p>
<p>Ongoing problems with PRTG were the 2,500 sensor cap – we always had to keep an eye on that and had regular housekeeping sessions removing things we didn’t need or PRTG would start disabling monitors if the number exceeded our cap. The WMI sensors would sometimes fail, and – especially in the last year – the PRTG itself has been prone to instability. Sometimes it would stop sending network traffic to its clients and put everything into alarm, notifying dozens of people out of hours – which was obviously not popular and undermined confidence in it a lot. We’d also not seen much in the way of improvements in PRTG over the time we used it. Granted, we weren’t crying out for change, but it felt like it was under-developed.</p>
<p>But none of the problems were big enough to consider changing, until Paessler were sold to the capital fund group, Turn/River, who quickly raised the prices. Paessler quoted us a revised fee on renewal which equated to around a 400% increase in cost. On the heels of the Broadcom acquisition of VMWare, we were quite sensitive to vendor lock-in and the squeezes being applied to customers in the industry, and myself and a colleague were given the task of considering alternatives to PRTG.</p>
<p>We quickly thought of Zabbix – after all, it has been around for ages and has a pretty good reputation. We set up a new linux vm, installed Zabbix and started to figured out how to automatically add most of our machines and quickly had a few hundred machines added.</p>
<p><em>(The process we used was: Linux machines – add the zabbix repo for our EL and Debian machines. Install zabbix-agent2. Change two lines in the zabbix-agent2.conf to tell it to use its own hostname and the address of the Zabbix server.  For Windows – much the same, just using PDQ to deploy the package and conf. With some auto-add subnet rules on Zabbix server, each new client would connect and be added with the right basic settings.)</em></p>
<p>And.. We’re happy. We turned off PRTG’s vm on Tuesday feeling confident we had everything monitored that needed to be, and had a whole lot more covered on top.</p>
<h1 id="heres-some-takeaways-if-youre-thinking-of-doing-the-same-thing">Here’s some takeaways if you’re thinking of doing the same thing</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Zabbix is good.</strong> Everything we did in PRTG is also doable in Zabbix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Start from scratch.</strong> There’s no “Press this button and migrate” option available to migrate from PRTG to Zabbix and even if there were, something like this is a good chance not to repeat previous design mistakes. You can export a list of devices from PRTG that may be a useful reference, but we have well defined subnet and were able to automatically discover most of our devices from the originating IP and have them appear in the correct host groups and have the right default templates assigned to them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>We can see more of our estate.</strong> We’ve increased our sensors from 2,500 to 43,000 and no longer have to spend time housekeeping to keep them within licence, or risk things going unmonitored because PRTG has turned sensors off because we exceeded our allowance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zabbix uses fewer resources.</strong> Despite handling almost twenty times the datapoints, at the server end, we’ve reduced ram from 16g to 8g and cpus from 4 to 2 and are keeping sysload consistently low. The disk sizes (2nd disk for a local mysql server exclusively for zabbix) is 110gb for Zabbix, vs 130gb used by prtg. On the clients, the lack of LDAP/SSH connections from PRTG every minute has been noticable – we monitor these for intrusion detection so there is a secondary interpretive load on ssh connections that we can bypass with Zabbix’s direct port connection. There is obviously some increased memory usage by having an agent running all the time with Zabbix but we think it’s remarkably meager. A glance at some clients now shows 16mb ram used by the windows agent and 27mb by the linux one. Disk footprint is less than 100mb for each.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quids in.</strong> We’re saving around $9,000 per year in licencing. As a company, we like FOSS and try to give back in some way. My employers are happy for us to submit bug reports, help in forums and sometimes submit PRs to resolve bugs directly. Sometimes we buy support or training from the company. Everyone wins with FOSS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zabbix is more stable.</strong> We haven’t had a single crash from either server or agent in six months. Meanwhile, PRTG had crashed up to twice a week, usually needing manual intervention to reboot the vm and get it going again. (It didn’t used to do this, so we think it’s a problem with the latest version)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Changing at scale is fun!</strong>  Do everything with templates and try to get this right the first time. We can now change settings for templates, apply new templates, and essentially change how every sensor operates with a few clicks. Templates can be linked and values are inheritied with default macros controlling specific things. Want to change the default warning for a low disk space alert? Just change the macro once in the template and suddenly everything is the same. Want that, but also have some servers that need different thresholds? Local Macros override the template, so you can do that too – nice! Having previously had to work through dozens or hundreds of sensors with PRTG to change values was quite tiresome. There may have been a better way that we never found.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Making bespoke sensors is easy – once you know how.</strong> We all have “those” pet machines which need something special monitoring. Adding UserParameter checks and monitors allows us to consume anything that can be generated on the command line and alert based on its value. (In fairness, bespoke sensors work quite well in PRTG too, no shade to be cast there) Because Zabbix supports .d/ config fragments, we can easily add these at scale to target host groups by deploying a new file just with the relevant UserParameter, and then a new template to import that Item and a Trigger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>There <em>is</em> a learning curve.</strong> Zabbix is a complicated piece of software and it’s not reasonable to expect to pick it up within a few days. However, the documentation is fairly good. Sometimes I found the official docs sparse – examples would be nice, or an explanation of what that feature was actually doing.The engineering decisions do make sense once you understand them, and it’s obvious that the core development team are not only passionate about the project, but technically very skilled too.
<em>Is the learning curve steeper than PRTG’s?</em> Hard to say as it’s a subjective thing, but maybe a little, but not so much that too much time was spent on any one problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zabbix is compatible.</strong> Not only does the Zabbix website provide regularly updated installers for all of our OS choices and linux repositories for automatic updating, we’re also sending alerts to Mattermost, email and Teams with varying levels of intentional delay and logic. It also talks to all our equipment in more ways than PRTG did, and more types of equipment than PRTG did. Adding monitoring via SNMP is never fun, but we found it easier with Zabbix than PRTG.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Grafana Plugin actually works!</strong> PRTG has never had an official plugin for grafana, and the community created plugin by neuralfraud was abandoned years ago. The angular framework that it uses is now deprecated by Grafana and will stop working soon, if it hasn’t already. Additionally, the PRTG plugin was bugged and we found that it often randomly reported latency instead of values which made the graphs rather useless.
By contrast, Grafana has a native, modern and fast plugin for Zabbix that “Just works”. It’s been a genuine pleasure to migrate our extensive dashboards over to Zabbix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support.</strong> As a free user, we obviously have no guaranteed SLA with Zabbix like with did with PRTG, but support contracts are available if that is important to your business. We did use PRTG’s support a few times and they were fine. Community support is important to both, but Zabbix’s community is very large, and in particular, there are far more templates available for different types of kit than for PRTG. We have had to write a few bespoke things, but we’ve also saved time by using those already available for Zabbix. The community forums are the usual mixed bag, with outdated or incorrect advice often given – the same as anywhere, but when I posted about a specific question relating to device id’s, I did get two useful responses within 24 hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Training.</strong> We were aware of the professional training courses available for Zabbix users, but we opted not to avail ourselves of it. Perhaps those with less free time may find it saves them time in getting to grips. We didn’t use training from PRTG when we set that up, either.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Timescale.</strong> We allowed six months of low priority project time for this migration, and it was a fairly comfortable timespan for us.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you can tell, I&rsquo;m a bit of a convert to Zabbix!</p>
<p>Monitoring systems aren’t easily changed for companies, and that’s probably why PRTG’s new owners ramped up the pricing so much – “vendor lock-in” is real. Some customers will undoubtedly accept the new pricing because they will find it difficult to move to something else, don’t have the time or skill to set something else up, or consider it cheaper than migration costs. Fair enough and I wish them well.</p>
<p>My purpose of writing this is to try and give a fairly balanced view of someone who has taken that step and to help inform others of what’s involved.</p>
<p>I am not a part of the Zabbix project and don’t represent them in anyway. We did research some alternatives, both commercial and FOSS, but Zabbix is so large in the sector that we did lean that way from the start.</p>
<p>Thank you, and good luck in whatever monitoring path you choose. May your alerts never be false.</p>
<h2 id="six-months-on">Six months on</h2>
<p>As I copy this article across to Hugo for yet another new version of my site, have my feelings changed?</p>
<p>No, they haven&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m even more impressed with Zabbix than I was. We&rsquo;ve had no problems with it and have gained a fair bit of admin time that was spent tending to PRTG&rsquo;s increasingly delicate reliability. We&rsquo;ve had no more worried employees concerned about what turned out to be false alarms, to the point we&rsquo;ve forced problems to ensure the alerting does actually work!</p>
<p>Zabbix server has been faultless. Not a single crash.</p>
<p>We <em>have</em> had the Zabbix agent stop a few times on Windows clients. That shows up within 5 minutes, and we only noticed because it was set not to automatically restart. Changing the service entry to restart on failure means that&rsquo;s a problem we&rsquo;ve only had to solve once.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it&rsquo;s brilliant. We&rsquo;re up to around 30,000 items being monitored across some 500 devices on a low spec vm (2x vcpus, 8gb ram) PRTG simply cannot compete at any level with Zabbix - except perhaps the UI, which may be slightly nicer. But not worth the cost, either financially or in terms of upkeep.</p>

<h1 id="backing-up-important-data">Backing Up Important Data</h1>

<p>Backing up your important data is essential. I&rsquo;ve built many systems over the years, and this is one system that I&rsquo;m currently using, having thought a great deal about it. It may not be what you need, but this may be worth reading as the core concepts are pretty sound, I think.</p>
<p>*<em>What to back up?</em> This is a core question to ask when you start planning. I think it&rsquo;s quite simply answered by asking the secondary question: “Can I get the data again?” Don&rsquo;t back up stuff you downloaded from the public internet unless it&rsquo;s particularly rare. No TV, no Movies, no software installers. Don&rsquo;t hoard data you can replace.</p>
<p><strong>Do</strong> back up stuff you&rsquo;ve personally created and that doesn&rsquo;t exist elsewhere, or stuff that would cause you a lot of effort or upset if it wasn&rsquo;t available. Letters you&rsquo;ve written, pictures you&rsquo;ve taken, code you authored, configurations and systems that took you a lot of time to set up and fine tune.</p>
<p>If you want to be able to restore a full system, that&rsquo;s something else and generally dealt best with <em>disk imaging</em> – I&rsquo;m talking about individual file backups here!</p>
<p><strong>Backup Scenario</strong> Multiple household computers. Home linux servers. Many services running natively and in docker. A couple of windows computers.</p>
<p><strong>Daily backups</strong> Once a day, automate backups of your important files.</p>
<p>On my linux machines, that&rsquo;s things like some directories like /etc, /root, /docker-data, some shared files.</p>
<p>On my windows machines, then that&rsquo;s some mapping data, word documents, pictures, geocaching files, generated backups and so on.</p>
<p>You work out the files and get an idea of how much space you need to set aside.</p>
<p>Then, with automated methods, have these files copied or zipped up to a common directory on an always-available server. Let&rsquo;s call that /backup.</p>
<p>These should be versioned, so that older ones get expired automatically. You can do that with bash scripts, or automated backup software (I use backup-manager for local machines, and backuppc or robocopy for windows ones)</p>
<p>How many copies you keep depends on your preferences – 3 is a sound number, but choose what you want and what disk space you have. More than 1 is a good idea since you may not notice the next day if something is missing or broken.</p>
<p><strong>Monthly Backups – Make them Offline if possible</strong></p>
<p>I puzzled a long time over the best way to do offline backups. For years I would manually copy the contents of /backup to large HDDs once a month. That took an hour or two for a few terabytes.</p>
<p>Now, I attach an external USB hard drive to my server, with a smart power socket controlled by Home Assistant.</p>
<p>This means it&rsquo;s “cold storage”. The computer can&rsquo;t access it unless the switch is turned on – something no ransomware knows about. But I can write a script that turns on the power, waits a minute for it to spin up, then mounts the drive and copies the data. When it&rsquo;s finished, it&rsquo;ll then unmount the drive and turn off the switch, and lastly, email me to say “Oi, change the drives, human”.</p>
<p>Once I get that email, I open my safe (fireproof and in a different physical building) and take out the oldest of three usb Caddies. Swap that with the one on the server and put that away. Classic Grandfather/Father/Son backups.</p>
<p>Once a year, I change the oldest of those caddies to “Annual backup, 2024” and buy a new one. That way no monthly drive will be older than three years, and I have a (probably still viable) backup by year.</p>
<p>BTW – I use USB3 HDD caddies (and do test for speed – they vary hugely) because I keep a fair bit of data. But you can also use one of the large capacity USB Thumbdrives or MicroSD cards for this. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter how slowly it writes, since you&rsquo;ll be asleep when it&rsquo;s backing up. But you do really want it to be reasonably fast to read data from, and also large enough for your data – the above system gets considerably less simple if you need multiple disks.</p>
<p><strong>Error Check:</strong> Of course with automated systems, you need additional automated systems to ensure they&rsquo;re working! When you complete a backup, touch a file to give you a timestamp of when it was done – online and offline. I find using <code>tree</code> to catalogue the files to a text file is worthwhile too, so you know what&rsquo;s on there.</p>
<p>Lastly – test your backups. Once or twice a year, pick a backup at random and ensure you can copy and unpack the files. Ensure they are what you expect and free from errors.</p>

<h1 id="land-rover">Land-Rover</h1>

<p>Best of British. (At least up until 2018 when the last &lsquo;Proper&rsquo; Land Rover rolled off the production line at Solihull. I&rsquo;m no fan of the modern cars.)</p>
<h1 id="why-do-i-like-land-rovers">Why do I like Land Rovers?</h1>
<p>Teenage boys usually have posters on their wall. Nothing unusual about, I did too. Except mine weren&rsquo;t of glamour models or music bands. My 1980&rsquo;s bedroom walls were covered by pictures I&rsquo;d cut out of 4x4 Magazines. Mostly Land-Rovers.</p>
<p>At work meetings, I&rsquo;d noticed people drew the same sorts of things over and over. One person drew horse heads, another geometric shapes, one did only angry spiky triangles! I drew Land Rovers. I&rsquo;d supressed that as I&rsquo;d gotten older, but in 2018 I had some upset at work that led to a fairly dark time in my life as I dealt with depression and anxiety. As my job had spread itself into most aspects of my private life too, I wanted something constructive to occupy my time and one night it occured to me – why not buy an old land rover that needs some love and fix it up?</p>
<p>I talked it over with my wife and she was supportive (even when she learned it would involve building a car port in front of the house!) and I started looking.</p>

<h1 id="tall-people-and-series-land-rovers">Tall People and Series Land Rovers</h1>

<p>One problem taller people often have in old Land Rovers is they can be really uncomfortable to drive. I’m 6’2″ and with the standard seats, I would start to get bad cramp in my ankle and legs after only 15 minutes or so. The adjustment in the seat is very limited because of the cross bulkhead immediately behind the seat.</p>
<p>There is a relatively simple modification which gives you an inch or two extra space that doesn’t seem to be widely used, however, and is cheap and quick to do. It’s also fully reversible!</p>
<p><strong>Remove the back of the seat!</strong></p>
<p>By then fixing a cushion directly onto the bulkhead, it is just as comfortable as the original seat on the back.</p>
<p>Here’s mine:</p>
<p>

  


<figure>

    <figcaption><p><b><i>Compare with a normal seat on the passenger side</b></i></p></figcaption>
  
</figure>
</p>
<p>The new cushion is simply one of the rear bench seat cushions cut in half and tidied over. It’s a close match to the standard Series 3 seat covering.</p>
<h2 id="stage-1-remove-the-seat-back">Stage 1: Remove the seat back.</h2>
<p>There’s an upright hinge either side with a small bolt that allows the seat back to hinge forwards. See the first picture, the triangular metal section. (One partly hidden by the seatbelt).</p>
<h2 id="stage-2-fix-your-new-cushion">Stage 2: Fix your new cushion.</h2>
<p>These seat cushions are simply a piece of hardboard, foam and covering. I drilled four small holes through the bulkhead and fixed the cushion on place with some short self-tapping screws. This has held well for me for four years, but you could also use screws, or self-adhesive velcro if you didn’t want to make holes.</p>
<p>The next picture shows one of the screws from the rear, painted over and barely noticable.</p>

</p>
<p>The standard Series Land Rover bonnet has no gas or spring assist, instead using a tethered prop. Replacing it with some gas rams makes it a lot easier to lift and also allows it to lift further and higher out of the way.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>The fitting is fairly simple – in this case I’ve used two fairly low powered rams (from the tailgate of a Toyota Yaris). These are mounted to a single plate fixed to the bulkhead, and onto a metal plate bolted onto one of the main ribs.</p>
<p>It works really well. Lift the latch and the bonnet pops up an inch, then a single smooth movement with a single finger raises it all the way as shown.</p>
<p>I’ve seen designs fitting them to one side which seems to get in the way when working on the engine, and also won’t give as good a support without a fair bit of additional bracing.</p>

<p>I saw a beautiful Series 2a on the original 1965 registration plates advertised on Ebay and “Locked on”. I checked with the wife to ensure that my thinking wasn’t too off-par. One of the side effects of depression is of course that it undermines your confidence in every way – and especially that you’re making good decisions. She told me that if I wanted it, I should have it!</p>
<p>So a phone call later and I was at a nice property 40 minutes away. The chap seemed to like the idea of owning a land rover, but wasn’t too pleased with the reality. He struggled to get behind the wheel (I did notice the seats were deeper than the original) and he had a poorly hip, so preferred to use his Porsche 4×4. I took a good look around and liked what I saw and promptly offered the full asking price if he had it delivered. Things were pointed out like the “Wiring needs fixing up” (Turned out to need a front-end rewire), Chassis is okay (it wasn’t bad and didn’t need any work) and that the Bulkhead had been replaced.</p>
<h4 id="lessons-from-this-were">Lessons from this were:</h4>
<ul>
<li>When the oil is clean and the battery is flat so it can’t be started, be suspicious. It turned out the head gasket was blown and the first time I ran it the oil turned to milk. Quite naughty, that.</li>
<li>The staining under the Landy turned out to be a leaking fuel tank that needed replacing.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Finishing the wiring is a five minute job&rdquo;. Of course it wasn’t. If it was, wouldn’t the owner have done it before trying to sell?</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I rationalised the purchase first in that if I was going to learn how to repair vehicles, this was a perfect example. The value of Series Land Rovers is appreciating quickly and I was hoping not to lose money as I learned. Truthfully, this was an emotional decision. Now this project is nearly complete, I don’t regret a moment of it. Even though I eventually left my job after 22 years, being able to switch off from it and focus on the Land Rover undoubtedly helped my recovery. It’s also taught me some very useful skills and given me the confidence with Vehicles to repair my Toyota Yaris as well as the Wife’s Shogun, saving many hundreds of pounds of labour.</p>

</p>
<p>First things first, I had to built Harry a home. I wasn’t going to leave him outside to get ruined. I’d made this mistake with a kit car previously, a very pretty JBA Falcon. Even a tarpaulin “Tunnel garage” wasn’t much better, causing condensation. I roughed up some plans and built a car port outside of my garage/workshop.</p>
<h1 id="starting-work">Starting work</h1>
<p>Now that I had ‘Harry’ home, I set to getting it running. Charging the battery got it started quite easily, but it ran rough.</p>
<p>After turning it off, I checked the oil and… Found it white and foamy. Only really one thing that can be – a blown head gasket. Bugger!</p>
<p>Having had a few cars sent to the scrapyard for just this problem, I was quite alarmed!</p>
<p>Despondent, I muttered for a while, then watched a few youtube videos and wondered just how hard it might be to do this. Everything seemed surprisingly simple, and that the Land Rover Series engine was about as easy to work on as any. So I decided to give it a go and, following the trusty Haynes manual, removed the rocker cover to be greeted with the classic grey sludge.</p>
<p>

    <figcaption><p><b><i>Milky deposits inside the rocker cover</b></i></p></figcaption>

</p>
<p>Then came the head, and I spent a few hours cleaning it up and painting it;</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>It was at this point that I noticed a tiny crack leading out from one of the ports. I asked around and was given the name of an engine specialist in Totnes and on ringing him, he said to “bring it down for a look”. I happened to be going that way the next day so I stopped by (complete with a car full of work colleagues) and I was told, firmly but kindly, that “It’s scrap. I could weld it, but it’ll never hold in that place.” Bugger again!</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>It turned out that one of my work colleagues knew someone who knew someone who might have a spare cylinder head, so I was given a number and sure enough, this chap thought he had one. I met him the next day (he only lived a couple of miles away) and sure enough, he’d removed the head from a Series 3 engine that was identical (An Ex SWEP cherry picker). This new head had been lying on its side in the weather for a few years, which made separating the manifolds a major effort (about four hours worth!) and the the ports were full of crud and the valve stems had rotted out. Fortunately, I could use the manifolds from my old head.</p>

<p>Several more hours and I’d succeeded in cleaning up the ‘new’ head fairly well, including polishing all the ports. I lapped in the original valves using the handy rubber-hose-and-cordless-drill technique which worked very nicely, broke a new set of valve spring compressors.</p>

<p>Job done! The feeling of going through this, as a novice, and actually getting a working engine again was brilliant. I needed to re-adjust the tappets a bit but the new head proved good and I did a few hundred miles without any further problems.</p>
<p>I also replaced quite a few parts - radiator, fuel tank, full service, greased, oiled and painted everything I could, including a full repaint of the exterior. (Landies are one of the few vehicles which don’t need a professional paint booth to look good - at least in my opinion!)</p>
<p>It was around then that I saw a 1974 Series 3 Land Rover for sale nearby, and I made the decision to sell the Series 2. It duly sold and went to a nice chap in Japan where I believe it still is today, being loved and used.</p>
<h1 id="timothythe-series-3">Timothy,the Series 3</h1>
<p>This turned into another long affair. This one came from a chap who had sadly died but who loved it. He had just fitted a reconditioned engine but health had prevented him finishing the job. I still have this Landy today and enjoy tinkering with it.</p>

<h1 id="honest-review-of-puig-touring-windscreen-for-the-royal-enfield-himalayan">(Honest) Review of Puig Touring Windscreen for the Royal Enfield Himalayan</h1>

<p><em>I bought it but I put the original back after only one ride…</em></p>
<p>The stock 2023 Himalayan is a great bike, but head and body wind protection is pretty minimal. Having come from a BMW R1200GS with an amazing Givi Airflow screen, I missed being able to ride with an open helmet at everything other than motorway speeds, so went shopping.</p>
<p>The only really affordable option I found was the Puig Touring screen, available Clear, tinted or smoked. So I paid £110 to the cheapest decent ebay supplier and bought it. It turned up a few days later, not very well packaged but was undamaged and still in original packaging.</p>
<p>Fitting was simple – screens are held on with four small bolts and it’s just a case of unscrewing them and putting them back on. I have an accessory bar also sharing these holes for my phone, but that doesn’t affect mounting at all.</p>
<p>Here’s what it looked like when mounted:</p>
<p>

</figure>
</p>
<h3 id="problem-1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>I was happy with that, but I had noticed that the screen moves a lot. That wide bit acts like a natural hinge and despite the plastic being reasonably thick, I could move the top of the screen back with my finger and very little pressure about an inch.</p>
<h3 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h3>
<p>So I hopped on and put the bike on full lock as I turned to leave my home. The mirrors hit the screen! I will admit that my left mirror is on an extension bar, but the right hand mirror is entirely stock. BOTH mirrors hit the screen at full lock. This is terrible! Not only does it risk damaging the screen. Not only did it push one mirror back out of alignment. But it’s also dangerous for it to interfere with the steering. That’s a part of the MOT check for British bikes so it could actually fail a safety inspection.</p>
<p>

</figure>
</p>
<h3 id="problem-3">Problem 3</h3>
<p>I’m 6’2″ tall, so I expected some buffetting on the stock screen. Somehow, this taller screen actually made that worse! It redirected air that was previously hitting me in the chest and pointed it right at my head, increasing buffetting. It actually lowered the speed where I closed my visor from around 40mph to 30mph, and I didn’t need any lunch after an hour’s riding because I’d eaten so many flies!</p>
<p>So, in all, a very disappointing purchase. I replaced the original screen as soon as I got back from that ride.</p>

<h1 id="selling-my-dream-motorbike">Selling My Dream Motorbike</h1>

<p>The TV Program, <code>Long Way Round</code> was what made me want a motorbike, and specifically a BMW GS. In my mid 40s and facing a mid life crisis, I decided to do bikes. I wanted to travel the world too. It looked cool, it looked fun, it looked interesting.</p>
<p>So I did my CBT (Uk basic test), bought a £300 Chinese 125 and rode through the winter to get some miles in. Then booked the DAS test (same as the EU bike test – it’s tough) and then went to a bike showroom and ended up buying a high-mileage 2004 BMW R1200GS with full luggage – even before I passed my test. Luckily I did pass and loved riding it.</p>
<p>But as I grew in experience, I began to think that it might not be the bike for me.</p>
<p>It was complicated. First the ABS pump died, and there’s lots of horror stories about that with the early BMWs. It knocked my confidence back a bit (as it died it fought back, releasing brakes at the wrong time, and pulsing heavily on corners. ) I had the ABS bypassed by a mechanic, and the brakes were brilliant after that. But I lived in fear of further problems. Clutch slipping? Oh no, that needs the bike splitting in half to replace! Rear bearing feel a bit sloppy? That needs a week in the workshop too. The alternator did seize, and I managed to replace that myself quite cheaply, but it was a big thing for me to do – I’m no mechanic.</p>

</p>
<p>But the main problem I had was – it’s too damned big and too damned heavy. I lived in fear of riding down a narrow lane and meeting a tractor. Trying to turn that lump around by myself downhill gave me sleepless nights. (Don’t tell me I could just spin the back wheel or pivot on the side-stand, I’m not that good a rider and these lanes have grass in the middle)</p>
<p>Then I saw the Royal Enfield Himalayan and loved its looks. I went to the local dealer and did a test ride. It was everything the GS was not – light (it’s not actually that light, but by comparison), very nimble and flickable, and is superb off road even on the stock tyres. Turning into my road there’s a patch of gravel that always made the GS slide the front wheel and tighten my sphincter. The Himmie doesn’t even notice it. I found myself driving up the middle bit of the lanes, full of mud and stones.The Enfield finds grip EVERYWHERE. So I rode back to the dealer and said &quot; &ldquo;When can I have one?&rdquo; &quot; &ldquo;Three days if you pick a colour we’ve got in stock”. &quot; &ldquo;Good, let’s do that then.”</p>
<p>I’ve owned the Himalayan for a little over three months. I’ve put a thousand miles on it – the average annual mileage I put on the GS in the past four years. I did the first service, I adjusted the valves. I enjoy maintaining it, working on it. It’s simple honest engineering that’s designed to do a job.</p>
<p>I’m now searching out green lanes and exploring my local county as much as I can, really enjoying the simple pleasure of just riding along roads without a destination in mind. &quot; &ldquo;Oh, that looks like an interesting road, let’s go there”</p>
<p>So the GS goes on eBay and I’ve just loaded it into a van to go to its next owner. I hope they enjoy it, it really is a nice bike. On the motorway it’s excellent, and the power for overtaking is superb. But I’ve often felt like I had to apologise to it for not being a better rider. I’ve been scared of it several times, I’ve never even pinned the throttle back all the way, and been startled by corners coming up way faster than I expected. I never once went off road because I think that to handle that much weight and power away from the tarmac, you need to be a very good rider.</p>
<p>There’s little comparison between the two bikes. The Himalayan is a little tractor that will go absolutely anywhere, and it gives back a huge amount of confidence to the rider.</p>
<p>The GS is a big, powerful German who wants to run up every hill and is disappointed if you don’t want to just nip across two countries and be back in time for tea. The Himalayan is a big friendly dog that is your best childhood friend and wants to do whatever you want to. It doesn’t judge you and it doesn’t feel bad if you just want to ride at 20mph along Devon lanes for an hour or two.</p>
<p>For me, the joy of riding is about the ride. It’s not about getting somewhere, so who cares if it’s slower? More time to look and and appreciate the countryside.</p>

<p><strong>Update, November 2023:</strong></p>
<p>Eight months of owning the Himalayan, and I’ve put 3,000 miles on it – more than I put on the GS in four years of ownership. And those are not motorway miles – the Himalayan is no trans-continental autobahn beast, it’s a plodder. Most of those miles are done at 20-40mph in narrow lanes as I explore my county of Devon. I’ve even done quite a few green lanes by myself, and joined the TRF to learn more about trials riding. (And learned that a Himalayan is not quite the tool of choice!) It suits me and I still like it a lot.</p>
<p>I’ve done the first service, including valve checks. It’s a very easy bike to work on and quite simple. It’s well made – all bolts are stainless steel, the frame’s strong. Maybe the engine light has a tendency to come on at the slightest excuse but you can generally ignore it if the bike sounds ok, and it’ll turn itself back off again after a while.</p>
<p>The new Himalayan 452 has been launched elsewhere, and it’s an interesting bike. I can certainly see why many people are interested in the increase of power. But I’m going to stick with my 411 and it’s 24.5 hp for a while longer, I think.</p>
<p>** Update, June 2025**</p>
<p>The Himalayan is up to 7,000 miles now and I still love it. It&rsquo;s a well built and reliable machine.</p>
<p>Problems I have had:</p>
<ul>
<li>Royal Enfield Battery died. I&rsquo;d had a lot of low voltage warnings and after 3 starts during a service, it refused to crank. I replaced with a cheap SLA 12AH battery costing £29 and have not had another warning light since. (I do keep it on a battery tender when not in use, which does help)</li>
<li>Wouldn&rsquo;t start after I&rsquo;d been fitting a pair of dashcams. Turns out I&rsquo;d pulled a wire out of the fuel pump connector through being heavy handed. 100% my fault and I managed to repair it.</li>
<li>A puncture on the first ride after I&rsquo;d replaced the rear tyre myself. Yep - my fault again. I&rsquo;d pinched the inner tube!</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion: Royal Enfield make good bikes that are reliable and affordable.</p>

</p>
<h3 id="the-reasoning">The Reasoning</h3>
<p>One of the most popular modifications for the Royal Enfield Himalayan is to replace the front drive sprocket which changes the gearing through all gears.</p>
<p>The stock Himalayan is fitted with a 15-tooth (15t) front sprocket which takes drive from the engine onto the chain. This provides reasonable gearing for the 24.5bhp for a wide variety of riding surfaces, but as the bike only has five gears, this means that top-end speed is undergeared, and to achieve motorway/highway speeds you must push the engine into the 5k to 6k range (70mph indicated = 5800rpm for my tests on stock tyres, level road). As the engine redlines at a low 6000 this means a lot of noise, vibration and engine wear to keep up with traffic.</p>
<p>For only £17 and an hour’s time, I was able to change this sprocket to a 16-tooth one which has resulted in a much nicer highway experience, and as I spend most of my time riding on tarmac, this was a good solution for me.</p>
<p>Should you do this? If you do a lot of road riding, particularly above 50mph, I would say yes, definitely. If you mostly ride on dirt, or narrow tracks, best to keep it as it was designed.</p>
<h3 id="the-process">The Process</h3>
<h6 id="parts">Parts:</h6>
<ul>
<li>1x Front Sprocket: 16-tooth (16t) 525 Pitch. Item part: 29055 16s
I bought mine here for £16.63 and it arrived in two days. It appears to be a common part between many Royal Enfield bikes, and this one was advertised for the Interceptor. It’s made by the German company ESJOT and is good quality. I think it will last just as long as the original. (Disclaimer: I receive no benefit from either company mentioned. I paid for the part as a regular customer and have no ongoing relationship with them.)</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="tools">Tools</h6>
<ul>
<li>A metric socket set. I also found a breaker bar useful to loosen the main sprocket nut.</li>
<li>12mm spanner to loose chain adjusters. (There’s one in the bike’s toolkit)</li>
<li>A hammer and screwdriver or punch to flatten the soft metal locking tab, and reset it afterwards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="process">Process</h3>
<p>I’ll describe it here, and there are good guides by other people if you need on Youtube: by Unfastened :: By Two Wheels Ben</p>
<p>Note: At 1500 miles, my bike’s original chain was sufficiently run-in that the original chain worked fine. Others have reported that you may need an extra link, or 112-link chain. I would suggest trying this anyway, reverting it is easy enough if you find you do need a longer chain, and you won’t be left without a bike. You don’t need to remove or split the chain to replace this sprocket, although if you’re doing both sprockets you may find it easier, especially if also replacing the chain.</p>
<p><strong>How I did it:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Put bike on centre stand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loosen main rear wheel bolt, and loosen both 12mm lock nuts to adjust the chain. Slacken the chain fully and push the rear wheel forwards to give the chain as much slack as you can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the two 8mm bolts on the sprocket cover (Front of chain) and remove cover.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a punch or screwdriver, flatten the soft and shiny washer behind the main nut – it will have a tab folded over to stop the main nut undoing. Just unfold it enough so the nut will turn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the correct socket, undo the main nut. (It’s a normal right-hand thread)</p>
<p>Hint: To stop the wheel turning, I went to the other side of the bike and pushed down the rear brake with my foot. Then, leaning over the bike, I used an extension bar to gain the leverage to undo the nut. It’s on tight!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the nut and soft washer, noting which way they’re facing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now remove the old sprocket. This is most easily done by sliding it out with the chain still around it. It should come off fairly easily as you’ve slackened the chain. Once off the bolt, you can unroll it from the chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare the old and new sprockets. The new one should be similar and fit the chain well. The writing should face towards you to help identify it once fitted, but the sprocket appears to be bi-directional. The original sprocket has a bonded plastic facing, which I think is for noise deadening, so they won’t look that similar – but it doesn’t make any difference to the fitting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fit the new sprocket into the chain and fit it over the drive bolt. This will probably be a snug fit, and you may need to use something to lever against the frame to persuade it home (don’t use anything metal or you may damage the frame and sprocket)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once located, rotate the wheel to ensure the chain is well seated and turns freely, and that there is adequate slack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refit the shiny washer in the same direction it came off, and refit the nut. Tighten the nut well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a screwdriver, bend the shiny washer up to stop the nut undoing – making it as it was before you began.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refit the sprocket cover with the two 8mm bolts. Warning: Soft bolts, do not overtighten!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tighten the chain to normal levels, and secure the locking nuts and main wheel bolt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a cup of tea.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-results">The Results</h3>
<p><strong>Normal Riding</strong></p>
<p>Not a huge amount of difference to be felt, it’s only a 7% or so ratio difference after all. I found it felt more like a normal road focused motorbike. Gear changes feel the same, no more or less vibration. The only thing I found was that I was more likely to bog the bike at low revs as I’d gotten used to changing up earlier. After just half an hour of riding, I’d got used to it though.</p>
<p><strong>Narrow lanes</strong></p>
<p>I live on Dartmoor on the UK and we have a lot of very bendy, narrow (less than 3m) tarmac roads set deep within high banks. Typical speed on these is around 20mph as visibility is low. Before, I was riding these in 2nd or 3rd and after fitting the sprocket, more often in 2nd but almost as often in 3rd, and keeping the same speed. No big difference here.</p>
<p><strong>Faster single carriageway roads (A and B classification)</strong></p>
<p>More noticable here, the Himalayan feels more normally geared. Progress is better, and overall slightly faster. There’s more of a speed difference between gear changes, perhaps I was holding on for another 5 or 10mph before changing up to 3rd or 4th. Before changing the sprocket, I would often ride these in 5th, but after I was more often in 4th, only changing up when I got about 45mph or higher. Before, I could easily leave it in 5th from 30mph onwards if riding lazily.</p>
<p><strong>Motorway / Highway (70mph legal limit, riding at 55+)</strong></p>
<p>This is where the modification really pays off and you will feel its benefits.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, I’d ridden back from Cornwall, which included a 90 minute stretch of the A30 which was running clear. At 60mph, there was noticeable noise and vibration and mechanical sympathy stopped me going to 70mph for more than brief overtaking spells. Even that relatively brief time left me with mild tinnitus, despite wearing earplugs and using the stock exhaust.</p>
<p>A test ride on the motorway after fitting this was much more relaxed, able to comfortably cruise at 65-70 with some power left in reserve for overtakes and hills, although steep hills will undoubtedly require a visit to 4th gear. I’m 6’2″ and 110kg, so it can support larger riders at this speed too. Whilst the Himalayan could do these speeds with a 15t as well, it ran out of RPMs way before it ran out of power. The bike itself is stable and comfortable at 70mph on a non-windy day.</p>
<p>Here’s the actual figures as I recall them.</p>
<p><em>Note: The Himalayan speedometer over-reads by around 5% (confirmed by GPS), and these speeds are from that, so actuals will be slightly lower. However, they are consistent enough for useful comparison.</em></p>

<li>Less engine wear</li>
<li>Better fuel economy</li>
<li>Easily reversed.</li>
<li>Cheap and immediately effective.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A taller first gear, losing some of the Himalayan’s tractor-like crawling ability at slow speeds.</li>
<li>The original lower gearing may be preferred by those who do mostly off-road, trail or mountainous riding, plus those who ride in cities as a commuter or who carry heavy loads.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h6>
<p>Like every modification one does to a vehicle, it’s a compromise that won’t suit every use-case. Motorbike manufacturers spent a lot of time and effort making the best bike they can for the money and original equipment is often the best for most riders. But things like gearing are a compromise, and this is especially true where we riders choose to use a bike designed for climbing mountains as a daily runabout on flat 70mph tarmac, so where we can adapt it to better suit our specific needs, it can be good to do so.</p>
<p>For under £20 and an hour’s time, you can easily improve your Himalayan’s on-road performance. It’s not surprising that this is one of the most common modifications that Himalayan owners perform. Even if a new chain was required, I think the cost is easily justified if you do any amount of highway work.</p>
<p>If you are not mechanically inclined, then any workshop will be able to do this for you if you supply them with the new sprocket.</p>

</p>
<p>I’m a huge fan of heated grips, having discovered them on my GS. When I was learning to ride a bike, I rode through the winter on a Sinnis Cafe 125 and often got so cold I’d have to pull over and warm my hands on the engine – sometimes every 2 or 3 miles. My circulation isn’t the best thanks to beta blockers, and that also means I get vibration numbness fairly quickly when it’s cold – so I pretty much consider grips a necessity for riding in the UK 3/4 of the year.</p>
<p>Oxford are a well known manufacturer of self-install grips, and as my new Himalayan came without such pleasures, I bought a set of their Adventure grips for £60 in 2023 and installed them.</p>
<p>I bought these with my own money and I receive no benefit for this review, nor am I linked to the manufacturer in any way. This is my honest opinion.</p>
<h3 id="so-whats-the-verdict">So, what’s the verdict?</h3>
<p><strong>Overall: 9.5/10</strong></p>
<p>Very good. Strongly recommended if you ride anywhere even slightly cold.</p>
<p><strong>Value: 8/10</strong></p>
<p>£59.99 (UK, Q1 2023) for well made, robust and weatherproof grips and controller seems like a very good price to me, and that’s someone who is not afraid to scour the internet to buy cheap. I bought these from Amazon.</p>
<p><strong>Quality: 9/10</strong></p>
<p>Good to very good. The grips are a little softer than the Himalayan’s original ones, which is fine – although I imagine they will wear through within several years. They’re very grippy as a result, which is good, and you don’t need to hold them as tight.</p>
<p>The controller is well sealed, very clear to use (pic above, it’s the box marked ‘Oxford’) and very simple to operate with one thumb without taking your eyes off the road. At the time of writing we’re close to Winter and I’m using them most trips.</p>
<p><strong>Heat: 9/10</strong></p>
<p>They’re not immediately hot, taking perhaps 2-3 minutes to warm up enough to feel through your gloves. But once up, they keep the set temperature very smoothly and I could detect no “modulation” where they get alternatingly hot and cold. The 5 settings are well spaced and I tend to use the 40%, 50% and 75% settings most. 100% is too hot for anything above sub zero temperatures, but it’s good to know it’s there if you need it.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions: 7/10</strong></p>
<p>Fairly typical “Few sheets of paper” installation instructions. Perhaps a little light if you’re unfamiliar with electrics or working on your bike, and you might want to seek some help. I do know people who have paid mechanics to fit these and that’s definitely an option.</p>
<p>I did disagree quite strongly with the instructions on one item, which is that they tell you to connect these straight to the battery (they include an inline fuse). This means you need to turn them off manually every time you stop, or they’ll stay on. This obviously uses the battery power and I believe will cause you starting problems if you do leave them on, especially in cold weather. As a protection, they say these will automatically turn off when the voltage drops to 11.5v, but I think that’s far too low and some bikes will struggle to start at that voltage. I used a switched-live relay to fit mine, which turns them off with the bike. That means you need to remember to turn them back on again, but auto-off is a small price to pay to be able to start your bike! I’ll detail that further below.</p>
<p><strong>Fitting: 9/10</strong></p>
<p>The whole fitting process took me a couple of easy hours with a couple of stops for tea and pondering. It’s well within the capabilities of most people, but if you’re unsure, stop and research before continuing.</p>
<p>**Step 1: Removing the stock grips. **</p>
<p>I slit mine open with a sharp knife – they’re glued, so sliding them off didn’t work, but if you’re more patient you may succeed where I failed.</p>
<p>*<em>Step 2: Fitting the new grips.</em></p>
<p>Ensuring you use the <code>R</code> and <code>L</code> grips appropriately, fit and glue them in place. I used superglue which has held up well.
Note: Be careful how you position the throttle side cable. I know someone who broke down because his glue failed and the grip slowly rotated until each time he let go of the throttle, the cable pressed against the bike’s kill switch which, as you can see in the top photo, is very easily crossed by the cable. His bike then stopped and it took a while for him to figure out why… The positioning in my photo has worked well for me but you should experiment to find what’s best for you and your bike.</p>
<p>**Step 3: Fitting the controller. **</p>
<p>I put mine on the left hand side where I can use my left thumb, but positioning is entirely personal. You may need a little fettling to expand the supplied bracket’s holes as I did, which I’ve protected with a clumsy blob of paint as in this picture:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: The wiring.</strong></p>
<p>Each grip connects to the controller with a nicely sealed plug and socket, and can be tidied away with zip ties, ensuring you have enough flex to turn the bars without straining anything. Then there’s just one cable to connect to your power source or relay.</p>
<p><strong>Where to connect to the power:</strong> I strongly, STRONGLY, recommend using a fused, switched live to power these grips.</p>
<p>Tip: Since I fitted mine, I’ve heard of a chap who took a supply from the horn feed, which he says is switched live and fused. (I have not verified this) That would certainly be easier than my method if so, and worth you checking. It also saves a good bit of cable tidying as it’s at the right end of the bike.</p>
<p>I ran the cable under the tank back to the battery area under the seat. This is what it looks like after connecting things.</p>
<p>

    <figcaption><p><b><i>Under seat cabling</b></i></p></figcaption>
  
</figure>
</p>
<p>You can see the shiny black cable with the in-line fuse carrier on its side coming in from the left (front). That’s going to the Oxford controller.</p>
<p>The red wire connects from a switched live I found in the small, black six-way connector that’s there, at least in 2023 Himalayans. I probed around with a multimeter until I found a switched live, then pushed the single wire in there (with a crimped connector), and folded it back, holding it in place with some black insulation tape. I did that rather than break into wiring so that I could remove this later if needed.</p>
<p>The other end of the red wire goes into that piece of bicycle inner tube which is protecting a standard automative relay and connects the battery positive to the Oxford feed wire.</p>
<p><em>For those unfamiliar with relays; A relay is simply a switch for a power feed that is controlled by a second feed. This allows high-power devices to be controlled by much smaller capacity switches. They’re widely used on all vehicles to simplify wiring. A starter solenoid is an example of a relay that prevents a very thick wire having to be run up to a very large switch controlled by a key – the key sends a small current to the solenoid which has a thick wire from the battery and allows current to flow to the starter.</em></p>
<p>This setup has worked well for me for a couple of thousand miles and should last indefinitely, but there are many ways to connect such things.</p>

<p>Perhaps not to everyone’s taste, but ammo boxes are cheap, strong and last forever. They’re easy to fit, too!</p>
<h3 id="backstory">Backstory</h3>
<p>I like to carry a few things when I’m riding. Tools, a can of tyre weld, a spare litre of fuel, a couple of cereal bars and, being English, a flask of tea. So luggage was always something I needed. However, the official RE Panniers are surprisingly expensive, so originally I fitted two £10 military surplus kit bags like so:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>These worked really well, quite roomy, no rattles and did well through the summer. But come the winter, the muck thrown up by the road made them very dirty and the contents wet, even when wrapped in plastic bags. They certainly weren’t unusable, but I fancied something else. 50cal ammo boxes are cheap and a good size, so I bought five for £30 off ebay, delivered. Good deal.</p>
<h3 id="fitting-ammo-cans">Fitting Ammo Cans</h3>
<p><strong>WARNING!</strong> This was written BEFORE ONE OF THE CANS FELL OFF!  The Ebay purchased mounts shown here were sub-standard. Not only did they rust through on the lower support arms on both sides, which failed after a few months (the metal is really thing) but one day the top weld snapped and the entire can&hellip; disappeared, along with contents.</p>
<p>First – I removed the old bags. I’ll use them again later for something, they are very useful and quite tough. That left the pannier mounts, which cost something like £24 – the European models don’t come with them fitted, nor with a Sari guard which is standard for the Indian market.</p>

</p>
<p>The boxes are 100% water and air tight (less the holes I made) and can be padlocked for security.</p>
<p>There’s no wind noise, no rattling (other than contents, but I put some thin rubber on the base inside to reduce that, and packed better). There’s no noticeable difference to how the bike rides. The only minor issue I had is the same for all hard panniers – pushing the bike means you will bump your thigh, and hoicking your leg over is a bit harder – as evidenced by the mud streak above.</p>
<p>If the storage isn’t enough, well, the front pannier mounts also have holes you can repurpose…</p>

<h1 id="improving-a-himalayan-seat">Improving a Himalayan Seat</h1>

<p>I love my Himalayan, but the seat is not its best feature. It&rsquo;s hard, strangely narrow and angles forwards. Not only giving you a numb and then increasingly painful rear end after a time riding, but also squishing your gentleman&rsquo;s equipment against the fuel tank.</p>
<p>My first attempt to fix this was the buy the genuine Royal Enfield “Touring seat” for £70.80. It&rsquo;s an easy swap – just remove the old and slip in the new. But, amazingly, I couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference! It felt exactly the same. It wasn&rsquo;t made the same; it was open underneath and there was a different mesh where it was solid in the other, but it was just as hard and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I tried with various seat-toppers. That helped a bit, as did a Sheepskin, but I needed 2 or 3 before I could ride more than an hour without a break, which left me teetering on layers of unconnected foam like the Princess and the Pea.</p>
<p>I also tried using my bicycling underwear. That was surprisingly good. Then I heard about Moto Skiveez – basically the same thing but with pads specifically for adventure riding. I bought some of those. Those were a little bit better and well made, but absolutely NOT worth the <strong>£62.50</strong> I paid for them! They are good pants, but not ten times better than basic cycling padded pants, which is what they cost. I consider Moto Skiveez to be 10% good product, 90% marketing.</p>
<p>So, figuring I might as well hack the original seat around a bit. If I messed things up, I still had the Touring seat.</p>
<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<ul>
<li>I bought a 2cm thick gel pad off Amazon for £25, watched some Youtube videos, and got to work.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion--was-it-worth-it">Conclusion – was it worth it?</h2>
<p>Yeeeess…? Probably? Maybe?</p>
<p>The seat <em>is</em> more comfortable. I&rsquo;ll ride a good couple of hours (I&rsquo;m a heavy bloke with a skinny bum so I&rsquo;ll take extra padding every time). I did still wear a sheepskin over the saddle.</p>
<p>What would I do differently? I&rsquo;m not sure the gel pad made much difference – maybe I buried it too low so its shaping qualities were lost. So perhaps if you do the same, consider your needs a little better than I did.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Update 2025: 2 years on</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst my modification <em>was</em> better than the original, it still wasn&rsquo;t ideal. I stripped everything back one rainy day and set-to again, focusing on much more foam. More! More! I&rsquo;d bought a waterproof seat cover for something else, and once I&rsquo;d added a big square of foam (from a car seat booster cushion), the original cover would no longer fit - but the extra one did. So now I finally have a comfortable seat that I can ride for 3-4 hours without feeling uncomfortable. It doesn&rsquo;t look good, but I&rsquo;d need professional help and a new properly fitted cover to achieve that. Upholstery is hard!</p>

<h1 id="villaging-with-the-himalayan">Villaging With the Himalayan</h1>

<p>I like to ride for pleasure at least once a week, but have been getting a bit bored with riding the same roads and lanes. I’m fortunate to have some beautiful countryside nearby (Dartmoor – I’m in England) but even so, it’s a bit repetitive eventually.</p>
<p>My solution to this ‘problem’ is to set myself a target – to take my Himalayan to every Village in my home county of Devon.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing this for a few weeks now – and about 40 villages. It’s going to take a while as there’s at least 450 of them.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, obviously, why not?</p>
<p>It gives me a form and structure to this hobby that I quite like.  I’m on the autistic spectrum, so planning and detailing such things is often as much fun as doing them, but enough flexibility that I can deviate if the mood takes me. Sometimes the bike tells me where it wants to go.</p>
<p>It’s showing me places and roads I would never normally ride, even though I’ve lived here for almost half a century.  Some of them are quite technical, especially slippery fords after heavy rain, and the road surface of some of our lanes are very broken, slippery and rough – not to mention many having grass growing in the middle.</p>
<p>And when I reach a village? Sometimes I’ll just ride through, sometimes I’ll stop and walk around. I always try and read the village noticeboard if there is one – it’s a hugely positive thing for ones mental health to realise that there’s a lot of little goodnesses going on every day, against the endless doom and gloom of the news cycles.</p>
<p>The Himalayan is the perfect bike for this. Nimble, agile, and light enough to do a U-turn within a lane, even when pointing downhill, if you meet something that can’t reverse, or the road’s blocked for some reason. It’s quiet enough not to upset horses or the wider public. It’s very economical, and just puts-puts from village to village.</p>
<p>I totally understand this isn’t the sort of thing most people will enjoy spending on their days off, and that’s fine!</p>
<p>How do you keep things interesting when you’re riding for pleasure?</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>After 5,000 miles and the Himalayan is pretty much perfect for me. Where they weren&rsquo;t, I made some tweaks to suit me.</p>
<h3 id="a-16-tooth-front-sprocket---16">A 16 tooth front sprocket - £16</h3>
<ul>
<li>This took half an hour to fit. Changing from the original 15t sprocket means that all the five gears are somewhat taller, but this allows for a much nicer on-road experience I&rsquo;ve found
<ul>
<li>Pros: Better economy, lower revs and vibration at motorway speeds. (RPM at 70mph drops around 600 from around 5200 to 4600)</li>
<li>Cons: Higher first gear. Can be a stretch to fit on a new chain.</li>
<li>Recommended? Yes, for all users except those who ride a lot of technical off road stretches where the lower 1st gear is most useful. Those riders may even consider a 14t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="clip-on-screen-protector---20">Clip-on screen protector - £20</h3>
<ul>
<li>A small generic clip-on screen extender. I tried the Puig screen but hated it, and the clip-on reduces buffeting enough for my 6’2″ lump.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fuelx-lite---150">Fuelx Lite - £150</h3>
<ul>
<li>The factory tuning for all modern motorbikes is very lean to meet emissions. Devices like the FuelX sit between the oxygen sensor and the ECU and change the signals to trick the ECU into delivering more fuel.
<ul>
<li>Pros: Engine runs cooler and has a stronger &ldquo;pick-up&rdquo; in revs, especially at the lower end. It&rsquo;s easily fitted and also easy to remove. (The Pro version has handlebar buttons to change maps, which require more fitment. I went with the Lite)</li>
<li>Cons: Slightly lowered economy.</li>
<li>Recommended? Yes. I didn&rsquo;t have high expectations of this, but I did immediately feel and hear the difference. It’s a small gain - maybe 1 or 2hp, but worth the relatively modest price, I think.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rear-pannier-frame---50">Rear Pannier Frame - £50</h3>
<ul>
<li>Necessary to fit saddlebags or panniers. There are many available, but fall into two camps: Official Royal Enfield, or Copy. I bought a Copy from an Indian seller on Ebay, all of whom seem to be selling the same item.
<ul>
<li>Pros: Easy to fit.</li>
<li>Cons: Terrible quality! Initially the welds looked poor, and the metal thing. Within a year, one lower strut snapped off, having rusted through from the inside. I inspected the other and found it was also about to fail, then replaced both with some flat metal I had. After that, I lost an entire 50cal Ammo can pannier complete with all contents (Tools, spares etc) somewhere on the road one day. The top weld had snapped entirely. I spent a few hours making better mounts out of angle iron - these definitely aren&rsquo;t going to fail!</li>
<li>Recommended? No!  The RE official item is probably better, but stick to branded pannier mounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sidestand-plate---5">Sidestand plate - £5</h3>
<ul>
<li>Just a little plate that bolts onto the sidestand. This keeps the bike slightly more upright, but widens the footprint to stop the bike sinking on soft ground. Happy with this.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="oxford-heated-grips---60">Oxford Heated Grips - £60</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I ride year-round and England is not a tropical country. I consider these essential on any motorbike ridden here in the grey six months of winter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: As easy to fit as they could be. Took a couple of hours, then another one to set up a relay to prevent me leaving them turned on after my ride.</li>
<li>Cons: Ensure they don&rsquo;t foul anything. I&rsquo;ve seen these fitted so they can knock the kill switch off, or even lead to a sticky throttle.</li>
<li>Recommended: Absolutely. Good value, well made, clear instructions. I use them often.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gps-mounting-bar---24">GPS Mounting Bar - £24</h3>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a bar that screws into the screen mounting bolts and provides somewhere to mount a GPS or phone. I added a Quadlock mount to it for my navigation phone.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="doubletake-mirrors---135">Doubletake Mirrors - £135</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not essential, just a bit wider than stock. I do like the OEM mirrors on the Himalayan, but even with extenders they didn&rsquo;t see past my shoulders. These are slightly better, and very tough. Well made, but probably not worth the money in hindsight - you&rsquo;re paying for the brand as much as the quality.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iridium-spark-plug-11">Iridium spark plug. £11.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don’t bother unless you need to replace the plug anyway, then it will last longer than most. And even then I’m not certain it’s worth the extra.  There&rsquo;s a lot of nonsense talked about this online about it improving MPG, smoothness. I didn&rsquo;t detect any changes whatsoever.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="50cal-ammo-box-luggage-15-for-2">50cal ammo box luggage. £15 for 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bolted onto the pannier frame. I like the look and they&rsquo;re waterproof, very strong and durable.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ebx-hh-sintered-front-pads-18">EBX HH sintered front pads £18</h3>
<ul>
<li>Himalayans are known for wooden front brakes. These do make an improvement over the original pads, but there&rsquo;s only so much pads can do. But they&rsquo;re a cheap and small improvement if you don&rsquo;t want to go down the expensive rabbit-hole of replacing the master cylinder and calipers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="replacement-rear-tyre-kenda-k761-72">Replacement rear tyre: Kenda K761, £72</h3>
<ul>
<li>The original CEAT rear wore out after about 4,500 miles. These have a slightly more aggressive tread, but both behave well on-road as and off-road as I ever go. The Kendas are wearing much better and should last 50-100% longer than the CEATs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hand-guards-13-generic">Hand guards £13, generic.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Essential in winter as they keep the hands warmer! They also do protect against brush hitting your knuckles - although I maintain that if you&rsquo;re hitting brambles and branches that hard, you should slow down to protect against the handlebar being snatched to the side!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="official-royal-enfield-touring-seat-85">Official Royal Enfield Touring seat. £85</h3>
<ul>
<li>I found this made no improvement to the comfort level at all and had just as much pain as the standard seat. I sold it on.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="puig-touring-screen-95">PUIG Touring Screen. £95</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hated this. Bendy, flexy and made head buffetting at motorway speeds even worse!  Removed and sold.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-generic-auto-chain-oiler-14">A generic auto chain oiler. £14</h3>
<ul>
<li>Spent quite a long time fitting this, then discovered it emptied all its oil overnight without being touched. Removed.</li>
</ul>
