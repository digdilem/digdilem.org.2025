      <title>Measuring Voltage With an Esp32</title>

      <description>A fun little project that has a useful function for me – wirelessly connecting a vehicle battery to Home Assistant.&#xA;Justification: I wanted to be able to check my vehicle’s battery was good, and automatically alert me if it wasn’t.&#xA;I own a classic Land Rover that doesn’t get driven enough, and I wanted to keep an eye on the battery voltage so that I knew when to put it on charge, using HA to alert me when it dropped below a certain point. That worked well for a while, but then I had much worse problems with my Motorbike which, despite two new batteries, went low enough to fail to start after only 10 days. I spent a long time trying to sort out the parasitic drain, but the general advice was “They all do that”. So I got a Optimate battery tender that trickle-charges it. The only problem was remembering to plug the thing in! So I moved my widget across to the bike shed and connected it directly to the 12v feed on the tender. Now, if I forget to plug it back in and the voltage drops below 12.6v, I get a SMS telling me I’ve been forgetful.</description>

      <title>Measuring Wind With Esphome</title>

      <description>One very windy Autumn night, I wondered just how hard was the wind blowing? Spotting a cheap anenometer on Ebay, I figured it was worth trying to add this to my HA setup. It turned out to be surprisingly easy and in just an afternoon, things were up and working beautifully.&#xA;The WH1090 in-situ and working&#xA;The Physical Bits One Anenemeter, a HADEX WH1080. Although pretty much any pulse-based meter will work. It has two wires and putting a multimeter across them, I saw that one full revolution opens and closes these wires three times. Considering how fast these things can spin, that’s going to take a lot of counting! I extended the wiring by soldering and heat-shrinking a 5 meter length of bell wire onto it, then tested again. I mounted it on a shelf bracket with a suitable sized bolt that neatly screws into the mount, as i don’t have the full weather-station kit this unit comes with. This sits near my garage, although it’s not a great position since it’s quite sheltered. However, this is just a fun little project and I’m not too worried about its accuracy, and I won’t be sharing speeds with anyone else. One ESP8266 or ESP32 or similar chip. I’ve used a Nodemcu chip without any additional backboarding or hats. I put it in an old light-switch box just for some protection from knocks. Inside this scruffy thing lies the ESP8266, honest! Next time I’ll take better photos</description>

      <title>Measuring Freezer Temperatures</title>

      <description>Please also read my article about keeping Zigbee and other battery devices running in sub-zero temperatures Or dealing with battery failure in minus twenty degrees.&#xA;Some years ago, I filled one of my freezers with frozen meat for my dogs and forgot to turn it on. My dogs helpfully reminded me three weeks later when it started oozing liquid out through the door. Finding a home for 80kg of rotted meat in open plastic bags was one of the less fun jobs I’ve had, and trying to prevent this happening again drove me to start monitoring their temperatures.</description>
