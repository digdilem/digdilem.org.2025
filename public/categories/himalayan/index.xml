      <description>I love my Himalayan, but the seat is not its best feature. It’s hard, strangely narrow and angles forwards. Not only giving you a numb and then increasingly painful rear end after a time riding, but also squishing your gentleman’s equipment against the fuel tank.&#xA;My first attempt to fix this was the buy the genuine Royal Enfield “Touring seat” for £70.80. It’s an easy swap – just remove the old and slip in the new. But, amazingly, I couldn’t tell the difference! It felt exactly the same. It wasn’t made the same; it was open underneath and there was a different mesh where it was solid in the other, but it was just as hard and uncomfortable.</description>
