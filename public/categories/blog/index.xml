      <description>The TV Program, Long Way Round was what made me want a motorbike, and specifically a BMW GS. In my mid 40s and facing a mid life crisis, I decided to do bikes. I wanted to travel the world too. It looked cool, it looked fun, it looked interesting.&#xA;So I did my CBT (Uk basic test), bought a £300 Chinese 125 and rode through the winter to get some miles in. Then booked the DAS test (same as the EU bike test – it’s tough) and then went to a bike showroom and ended up buying a high-mileage 2004 BMW R1200GS with full luggage – even before I passed my test. Luckily I did pass and loved riding it.</description>
