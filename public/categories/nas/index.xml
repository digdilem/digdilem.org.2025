      <title>Proxmox Backup Server on a Ugreen DXP2800 NAS in Docker</title>

      <description>I’m a recent convert to Proxmox, the Virtualisation Environment. I’m running it on my homelab and find it excellent.&#xA;Although Proxmox comes with its own backup system that is perfectly functional and reliably makes backups of my virtual machines on any schedule you like, I wanted to explore the free partner to it, Proxmox Backup Server And, having a new NAS that can run things on, I thought I’d try to get PBS running on there. Although I was already saving my backups to the NAS via a normal file share, it made sense to have PBS running directly on it rather than on the machine that might fail in the name of separation in case of hardware failure or disaster.</description>

      <description>I recently got a new NAS, a UGreen DXP2800, and wanted to add it to me existing Zabbix Server to monitor disk space and get alerts when I was running low. I couldn’t find much information about how to do this, so I wrote this for those who follow after.&#xA;The Ugreen DXP 2800&#xA;Whilst you can mount in each network share into an existing machine that already has a Zabbix Agent running, I wanted to run the agent on the NAS itself - it is just a linux server, after all.</description>

      <title>Disabling the Ugreen Nas Indexer</title>

      <description>I have a UGREEN NASync DXP2800 NAS. It’s very good with some lovely design touches like the toolless caddies that are amongst the best I’ve ever used, including many enterprise systems.&#xA;But one thing annoys me, and others too, is that it has an inbuilt indexer and thumbnail generator for photos that runs on the files you upload, regardless of whether you want it to, or are even using the bundled Photo software or indexer. Some of use a NAS just to store files for other programs.</description>
