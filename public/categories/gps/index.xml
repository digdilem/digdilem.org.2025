      <description>Making two excellent pieces of free software talk to each other&#xA;Traccar is an amazing piece of free, open source software to track GPS devices and people. GPSLogger is an amazing piece of free software that records GPS tracks on Android very well. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could use GPSLogger to send your position to Traccar? Well, you can, and it’s not hard.&#xA;Why not just use Traccar’s Android client? A good question, and there’s no reason why not. It (usually) works fine. however, I did have a few issues with it that, whilsts not serious, were enough to steer me towards GPSlogger.</description>
