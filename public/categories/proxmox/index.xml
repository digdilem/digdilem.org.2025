      <description>I’m a recent convert to Proxmox, the Virtualisation Environment. I’m running it on my homelab and find it excellent.&#xA;Although Proxmox comes with its own backup system that is perfectly functional and reliably makes backups of my virtual machines on any schedule you like, I wanted to explore the free partner to it, Proxmox Backup Server And, having a new NAS that can run things on, I thought I’d try to get PBS running on there. Although I was already saving my backups to the NAS via a normal file share, it made sense to have PBS running directly on it rather than on the machine that might fail in the name of separation in case of hardware failure or disaster.</description>
