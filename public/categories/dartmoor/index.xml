      <description>*Dartmoor is a vast, wild, and rugged upland area in Devon, England, characterized by extensive granite tors, heather-clad moorland, and deep river valleys. It’s a national park known for its dramatic landscapes, rich prehistoric archaeology including stone circles and hut circles, and unique wildlife, as well as its iconic Dartmoor ponies that roam freely. The area is steeped in history and folklore, offering diverse opportunities for walking, exploration, and experiencing a truly untamed natural environment.&#34; – Gemini AI when asked to sum up Dartmoor.</description>
