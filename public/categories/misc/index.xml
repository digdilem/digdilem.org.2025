      <description>Making two excellent pieces of free software talk to each other&#xA;Traccar is an amazing piece of free, open source software to track GPS devices and people. GPSLogger is an amazing piece of free software that records GPS tracks on Android very well. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could use GPSLogger to send your position to Traccar? Well, you can, and it’s not hard.&#xA;Why not just use Traccar’s Android client? A good question, and there’s no reason why not. It (usually) works fine. however, I did have a few issues with it that, whilsts not serious, were enough to steer me towards GPSlogger.</description>

      <title>Disabling the Ugreen Nas Indexer</title>

      <description>I have a UGREEN NASync DXP2800 NAS. It’s very good with some lovely design touches like the toolless caddies that are amongst the best I’ve ever used, including many enterprise systems.&#xA;But one thing annoys me, and others too, is that it has an inbuilt indexer and thumbnail generator for photos that runs on the files you upload, regardless of whether you want it to, or are even using the bundled Photo software or indexer. Some of use a NAS just to store files for other programs.</description>
