      <description>Text Adventures&#xA;During the late 1980s and early 1990s, I was a part of the thriving British Text Adventure scene and as well as enjoying many such games, I wrote a few too. Many of these were sold through Joan Pancott’s “Witch of Wessex Software” company. Some were freeware. These were written for 8-bit and 16-bit computers, with later ones running on PC.&#xA;A collection of my Text Adventures for various formats can be found on my github page You can play some these adventures directly from your browser here!</description>
