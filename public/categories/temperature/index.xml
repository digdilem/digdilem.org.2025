      <description>The Aqara (and other) Zigbee devices are great in almost every situation. But when using them in cold conditions, such as inside a freezer, the default CR2032 batteries don’t last well, especially in subzero temperatures.&#xA;Fortunately, it’s really simple to adapt them to use the much larger and commonly available 18650 Lithium rechargable batteries. I’ve had several of these batteries reporting the temperature of my freezer in around -20c for over a year without needing recharging – quite remarkable!</description>

      <description>Please also read my article about keeping Zigbee and other battery devices running in sub-zero temperatures Or dealing with battery failure in minus twenty degrees.&#xA;Some years ago, I filled one of my freezers with frozen meat for my dogs and forgot to turn it on. My dogs helpfully reminded me three weeks later when it started oozing liquid out through the door. Finding a home for 80kg of rotted meat in open plastic bags was one of the less fun jobs I’ve had, and trying to prevent this happening again drove me to start monitoring their temperatures.</description>
