      <description>One very windy Autumn night, I wondered just how hard was the wind blowing? Spotting a cheap anenometer on Ebay, I figured it was worth trying to add this to my HA setup. It turned out to be surprisingly easy and in just an afternoon, things were up and working beautifully.&#xA;The WH1090 in-situ and working&#xA;The Physical Bits One Anenemeter, a HADEX WH1080. Although pretty much any pulse-based meter will work. It has two wires and putting a multimeter across them, I saw that one full revolution opens and closes these wires three times. Considering how fast these things can spin, that’s going to take a lot of counting! I extended the wiring by soldering and heat-shrinking a 5 meter length of bell wire onto it, then tested again. I mounted it on a shelf bracket with a suitable sized bolt that neatly screws into the mount, as i don’t have the full weather-station kit this unit comes with. This sits near my garage, although it’s not a great position since it’s quite sheltered. However, this is just a fun little project and I’m not too worried about its accuracy, and I won’t be sharing speeds with anyone else. One ESP8266 or ESP32 or similar chip. I’ve used a Nodemcu chip without any additional backboarding or hats. I put it in an old light-switch box just for some protection from knocks. Inside this scruffy thing lies the ESP8266, honest! Next time I’ll take better photos</description>
