    <title>Shawn :: Digital Dilemma</title>

    <description>Meet Shawn, my Remote Controlled Lawn Mower.&#xA;Shawn, 2025&#xA;More pictures and videos down below About Shawn We own this steep 5-acre field on Dartmoor where we graze our horses. As horses are not very good at grazing off weeds, it needs topping twice a year to keep the grass in good condition. When we bought the land, it was very neglected, with a lot of high bramble growth and bracken which took weeks to clear. As it’s too steep for tractors (Most of it is about 30’, with parts up to 45’) my wife and I did this ourselves using petrol strimmers. It took months of work to get it in a state good enough to call the fencers in, and they too struggled with the grade.</description>
