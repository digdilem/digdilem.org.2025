    <title>Make a smarter Diffuser :: Digital Dilemma</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/home-automation/smarter-diffuser/index.html</link>
    <description>Making a diffuser a little smarter Making nicer smells My dumb diffuser&#xA;I bought this bargain diffuser second-hand from Ebay last year. You fill the container with water and add a few drops of an essential oil and it makes your room smell nice. There’s a little ultrasonic emitter inside that turns the liquid into a cool mist that pours forth from the tip.&#xA;It works well enough like this. You press a button and it starts. You press the same button two more times and it stops. There are some pretty lights too.</description>
