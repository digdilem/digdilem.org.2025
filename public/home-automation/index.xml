      <description>The Aqara (and other) Zigbee devices are great in almost every situation. But when using them in cold conditions, such as inside a freezer, the default CR2032 batteries don’t last well, especially in subzero temperatures.&#xA;Fortunately, it’s really simple to adapt them to use the much larger and commonly available 18650 Lithium rechargable batteries. I’ve had several of these batteries reporting the temperature of my freezer in around -20c for over a year without needing recharging – quite remarkable!</description>

      <description>(Free in third party energy costs, anyway)&#xA;Update after three years I’ve not had to change or maintain any of this setup – everything has continued to work perfectly. Through the summer, a typical sunny day charges the 5.4kwh battery by about 11 AM, then heats the water and exports to the grid for another few hours before the hot water’s heated. For our house of two, that meant the LPG boiler that normally heats the water stayed off through all of July and August, and most of June and September. Not bad for an investment of £85</description>

      <title>Using Gpslogger for Traccar</title>

      <description>Traccar is an amazing piece of free, open source software to track GPS devices and people.&#xA;However, I had trouble getting accurate results through its Traccar Client Android app – it would report positions miles away from where I was, and a journey was logged with very strange results indeed. However, GPSLogger already running on the same device was extremely accurate.&#xA;I’ve since learned that changing Traccar’s client to ‘High Sensitivity’ does fix most of the inaccuracies, but I still preferred GPSLogger which could also record a local GPX and upload to Gdrive at the same time I decided to use GPSLogger’s Custom URL feature to use that to update Traccar, and skip using the dedicated client entirely. This also meant one less app running on my phone, as I use GPSLogger to automatically create GPX files of my journeys.</description>

      <title>Measuring Freezer Temperatures</title>

      <description>Please also read my article about keeping Zigbee and other battery devices running in sub-zero temperatures Or dealing with battery failure in minus twenty degrees.&#xA;Some years ago, I filled one of my freezers with frozen meat for my dogs and forgot to turn it on. My dogs helpfully reminded me three weeks later when it started oozing liquid out through the door. Finding a home for 80kg of rotted meat in open plastic bags was one of the less fun jobs I’ve had, and trying to prevent this happening again drove me to start monitoring their temperatures.</description>

      <description>Just some cool ideas for automation if you’re looking for inspiration, or justifying why Home Automation can be useful.&#xA;Automatic Night Lights Problem: Like many people into their middle age, I sometimes need to visit the toilet at night. Turning on lights and remembering to turn them off wasn’t the biggest deal in the world, but I thought it woke my brain up just a little bit more than it needed.</description>
