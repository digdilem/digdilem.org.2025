<h1 id="measuring-voltage-with-an-esp32">Measuring Voltage With an Esp32</h1>

<p><em>A fun little project that has a useful function for me – wirelessly connecting a vehicle battery to Home Assistant.</em></p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: I wanted to be able to check my vehicle&rsquo;s battery was good, and automatically alert me if it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I own a classic Land Rover that doesn&rsquo;t get driven enough, and I wanted to keep an eye on the battery voltage so that I knew when to put it on charge, using HA to alert me when it dropped below a certain point. That worked well for a while, but then I had much worse problems with my Motorbike which, despite two new batteries, went low enough to fail to start after only 10 days. I spent a long time trying to sort out the parasitic drain, but the general advice was “They all do that”. So I got a Optimate battery tender that trickle-charges it. The only problem was remembering to plug the thing in! So I moved my widget across to the bike shed and connected it directly to the 12v feed on the tender. Now, if I forget to plug it back in and the voltage drops below 12.6v, I get a SMS telling me I&rsquo;ve been forgetful.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardware">The Hardware:</h2>
<ul>
<li>A nodemcu ESP8266 board circuit board (Other boards will work too)</li>
<li>A power shield to step the incoming ~12v voltage down to a level that the ESP8266 can accept</li>
<li>A car cigarette-lighter USB adapter (To stop the 12v down to ~5v and power the ESP8266)</li>
<li>A box to keep it in (I used a standard UK wall-mount socket with blanking plate, but any box works as long as it provides some protection against knocks and the weather if it&rsquo;s exposed to them. I&rsquo;ve even used Chinese Takeaway containers)</li>
</ul>
<p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Notes: If you&rsquo;re running the ESP from a separate power supply, perhaps by measuring the voltage coming out of a trickle-charger instead of directly to the battery, you obviously won&rsquo;t need any 12 -&gt; 5v adapter</em></p>

<h2 id="esphome-code">ESPHome code:</h2>
<p>Esphome makes programming chips really as easy as it could be. I&rsquo;ve always been interested in doing this, but had struggled with the thought of soldering and electronics generally. No need for any of that with this project.</p>
<p>I installed esphome on a little low power PC that runs Debian and connected the ESP8266 via a usb lead. I then followed their instructions for creating a new project, and wrote the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>esphome:
  name: voltage
  platform: ESP8266
  board: nodemcu

# Enable logging

# Enable Home Assistant API

  ssid: &#34;WifiSSID&#34;
  password: &#34;WifiPass&#34;

  # Enable fallback hotspot (captive portal) in case wifi connection fails
  ap:
    ssid: &#34;Esphome Voltage Fallback Hotspot&#34;
    password: &#34;WifiPass&#34;

captive_portal:

#deep_sleep:
#  run_duration: 20s
#  sleep_duration: 10min

sensor:
  - platform: adc
    pin: A0
    name: &#34;Bike Voltage&#34;
    update_interval: 60s
    filters:
      - multiply: 24.8</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="notes-about-the-code">Notes about the code:</h2>
<ul>
<li>I first used this code on my Landrover, which took power from the main battery. The deep_sleep section puts the chip into a very low power state which saved a lot of drain. As my bike is connected to the output wires from a trickle charger, I commented out this section as I no longer need it.</li>
<li>The <em>multiply</em>: value of 24.8 took quite a lot of trial and error to be accurate. I used a reliable multimeter on the same voltage source on my bench and then experimented with this until it matched. The power shield steps the voltage down to below the 3.3v that the chip can accept. If you connect 12v directly to the chip, it&rsquo;s going to blow, so reducing it, reading it and then multiplying that value is the only way for this to work. Sounds quite hacky but it&rsquo;s surprising how often solutions like this exist to get around such problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is then compiled by esphome and and uploaded to the chip via the usb lead and starts running.</p>
<p>Any future updates to this code can be done without connecting it – esphome will connect to the device over the wifi connection and, by magic, update the code remotely!</p>
<p>ESPHome also runs as an integration in Home Assistant, and once installed, will automatically register new devices to itself.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>That entity this integration creates is then available within HA to do anything we want with. We can stick it on HA&rsquo;s own dashboard like so</p>
<p>

</figure>
</p>
<p>And, by exporting it to Grafana, show prettier graphs of any range we like. In this one, we see the battery tender going through a cycle of topping up the battery, then sleeping for a bit, then repeating.</p>
<p>

</figure>
</p>
<p>I also have an Automation in Home Assistant that alerts me when the voltage drops below 12.2v, or stops updating for 24h as that means my bike is going to struggle to start and I&rsquo;d rather find that out before I put on all my leathers and get ready to go out! The reason is usually because I&rsquo;ve forgotten to plug it back into the charger!</p>

<h1 id="measuring-wind-with-esphome">Measuring Wind With Esphome</h1>

<p>One very windy Autumn night, I wondered just how hard was the wind blowing? Spotting a cheap anenometer on Ebay, I figured it was worth trying to add this to my HA setup. It turned out to be surprisingly easy and in just an afternoon, things were up and working beautifully.</p>
<p>

<h2 id="the-physical-bits">The Physical Bits</h2>
<ul>
<li>One Anenemeter, a HADEX WH1080.
<ul>
<li>Although pretty much any pulse-based meter will work.</li>
<li>It has two wires and putting a multimeter across them, I saw that one full revolution opens and closes these wires three times. Considering how fast these things can spin, that’s going to take a lot of counting!</li>
<li>I extended the wiring by soldering and heat-shrinking a 5 meter length of bell wire onto it, then tested again.</li>
<li>I mounted it on a shelf bracket with a suitable sized bolt that neatly screws into the mount, as i don’t have the full weather-station kit this unit comes with. This sits near my garage, although it’s not a great position since it’s quite sheltered. However, this is just a fun little project and I’m not too worried about its accuracy, and I won’t be sharing speeds with anyone else.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One ESP8266 or ESP32 or similar chip.
<em>I’ve used a Nodemcu chip without any additional backboarding or hats. I put it in an old light-switch box just for some protection from knocks.</em></li>
</ul>

</p>
<h2 id="connecting-the-bits">Connecting the bits</h2>
<p>The ESP8266 connects to HA by wifi, so it only needs a USB power supply and whatever connections we’re poking into it.</p>
<p>The Anenometer has two wires, and they open and close three times per revolution. It shouldn’t matter which way around they are connecting as we only care that they open and close.</p>
<p>I connected these to pins GND and GPIO14 next to it (which is Pin D4 on the board) – see this useful reference for the NodemCPU to figure out which pins go where.</p>
<p>That’s it! One micro usb connector supplying 5v and two wires.</p>
<h2 id="the-esphome-code">The ESPHome code</h2>
<p>(I won’t cover the ‘Getting started’ bit of ESPhome – they have their own excellent documentation <a href="https://esphome.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
<p>Before I placed the ESP8266 in position, I connected it to a small Linux PC via USB and did this;</p>

cd /opt/esphome/anenomter
esphome wizard configuration anenometer.yaml</code></pre></div>
<p>This creates a directory for the files and changes into it, then sets up the initial yaml file for the project. Once you’ve answered some basic questions, you’re can then edit the anenometer.yaml file with the editor of your choice. (I use vi, but you do whatever you like)</p>
<p>This is what my anenometer.yaml file looks like once I’ve added in some bits</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>esphome:

<p>Now, to explain some of the sensor bits here that might not be self-evident:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: What Home Assistant will call this entity.</li>
<li><strong>filters</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>multiply</strong>: This is where the trial and error comes in. At this stage, I’m guessing as I have no other point of reference, but this seems roughly to match the Beaufort Scale over the past few days. Do experiment with this value yourself. (The fact this is less than 1 means the multiplication is actually a division)</li>
<li><strong>sliding_window_moving_average</strong>: This allows us to count a bunch of pulses and then send a value every N number. Without this we would be trying to send every pulse, and as each rotate is three pulses, that might not be so good.</li>
<li><strong>window_size</strong>: How many pulses to read before establishing an average number over that time. This could be much larger to eliminate gusts, but it would be much slower to update in non-windy conditions.</li>
<li><strong>send_every</strong>: How many pulses are received before sending an update to HA.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, Esphome has better and accurate documentation on each of these items <a href="https://esphome.io/components/sensor/index.html" rel="external" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>That’s about it! The config was first uploaded to the ESP8266 using esphome run anenometer.yaml and then choosing the right-looking USB port.</p>
<p>Once it’s up though, you can change this file and update the ESP8266 over the air by re-running the same command and choosing “Over the air” instead of selecting a USB port. Magic!</p>
<h2 id="one-last-thing">One last thing!</h2>
<p>You’ll need to know what IP address your new ESP8266 was given. I find this out by checking my router’s DHCP list, but you can also use arpwatch to look for new devices.</p>
<h2 id="home-assistant">Home Assistant</h2>
<p>To add the new ESP8266 device to HA, we need to</p>
<ul>
<li>Go into Settings -&gt; Devices &amp; Services in Home Assistant</li>
<li>Click Add Integration</li>
<li>Select ESPHome</li>
<li>Enter the IP Address of your new ESP8266 (See ‘One Last Thing!’ above) and leave the default port of 6053 as it is. Click Submit.</li>
<li>Your new device should appear in the ESPhome panel on the Integrations page, and selecting it will show it has one entity – which should be called Windspeed and have the entity id of sensor.windspeed_meter</li>
<li>Clicking on that entry, and into the Info tab should show some data, and after a little while, look something like this</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="using-one-wire-sensors-in-esphome">Using One Wire sensors in ESPHome</h1>

<p>Onewire / 1wire / one wire / Dallas / Maxim is a very cheap way to deploy single or multiple temperature sensors, plus some other devices such as mini wireless buttons.</p>
<p>I’ve been using them at my house for around twelve years with lots of success, first connecting them to Domoticz and later, Home Assistant. There&rsquo;s several ways to use them and I&rsquo;ll explain a couple.</p>
<h1 id="one-wire-with-home-assistant-esphome-and-esp32esp8266-controllers-or-usb">One wire with Home Assistant (ESPHome and ESP32/ESP8266 controllers, or USB)</h1>
<p>This is my absolute favourite way of using these sensors nowadays. I find working with ESPHome a pleasure and the wiring is very simple and forgiving. There are various forms of connectors</p>
<p><em>This guide assumes you have set up ESPHome already and have a microcontroller ready to be written</em></p>
<h2 id="step-1---the-physical-wiring">Step 1 - The physical wiring.</h2>
<p>There are two main type of 1-wire temp sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The DS1820 or DS18S20 bare sensor  <figure><img src="/home-automation/esphome/one-wire/ds1920.jpg"
    alt="DS1820 or DS18S20" width="290px">
</figure>
</li>
<li>The DS18B20 or Waterproof <figure><img src="/home-automation/esphome/one-wire/ds18b20.jpg"
    alt="DS18B20 or Waterproof" width="290px">
</figure>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people will buy the DS18B20 which is easier to assemble and still very cheap.</p>
<h4 id="connections">Connections:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Red wire of DS18B20, Pin 3 (VDD) of DS1820 should be connected to between 3 and 5v.  Both these voltages are typically available on an ESP, but 3.3 is the more commonly used.</li>
<li>Black wire of DS18B20, Pin 1 (GND) of DS1820 1 should be connected to GND on the ESP.</li>
<li>Yellow wire of DS18B20, Pin 2 (DQ) of DS1820, should be connected to the GPIO port you choose on your ESP.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-resistor">The Resistor</h4>
<ul>
<li>A resistor should be placed between the Red and Yellow (Pins 1 and 3 on the DS1820) to &ldquo;Pull up&rdquo; the bus. This should be 4.7k ohms. However, I have tested with various resistors down to 1kohm, and even omitted it entirely and had satisfactory results. But it does seem to work best with 4.7kohms used.</li>
<li>The resistor should be connected as close to the ESP as possible, so it affects the whole bus.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="mermaid align-center ">flowchart TD

    n4 --&gt; n7</pre>
<h4 id="connecting-multiple-sensors-to-one-bus">Connecting multiple sensors to one bus</h4>
<ul>
<li>References to a &ldquo;Bus&rdquo; in other documentation simply means the wire network this system runs on, especially when there are multiple sensors connected.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is simply done by creating either a single &ldquo;star&rdquo; where multiple sensors are fed from the same connections, or from multiple stars where connections are made from a common backbone wire. In all cases, it is simply a case of connecting all the same wires or pins together. Every red to a red, every black to a black, every yellow to a yellow - until the first connection which goes to the relevant pins on the ESP.</p>
<p>

</p>
<h6 id="notes">Notes:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Either sensor can run at between 3 and 5v dc and the red/pin3 can be connected to either. It does not affect accuracy which is used.</li>
<li>Sensors have a unique ID which is reported along with their readings along the common &ldquo;bus&rdquo; back to the ESP or controller. This ID is how we identify which device is supplying which reading.</li>
<li>It is possible to run large lengths of one-wire with many devices. I personally have run a bus of around 80 feet with 12 sensors connected to it.</li>
<li>One wire can be remarkably resilient on the type of wire it uses. There are recorded cases if people using house pipework.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s reported that longer installations work best with an external 5v power supply, but I have had no problem using an ESP&rsquo;s 3.3v output. The current needed is tiny.</li>
<li>Although it&rsquo;s called one wire, a good installation requires three cores.</li>
<li>That said, it is possible to create a network by connecting only two cores. This is done by connecting the red and yellow wires of the DS18B20 (The outer two, GND and VDD of a DS1820). This can work very reliably and avoids the needs of a resistor, but should only be considered if three core wire is unavailable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-2---ok-so-the-wirings-done-what-about-taking-readings">Step 2 - Ok, so the wiring’s done, what about taking readings?</h2>
<p>There are multiple ways to get the readings into Home Assistant.</p>
<h3 id="esphome">ESPHome</h3>
<p>Assuming you already have an ESP set up and ready to use.</p>
<p>Connect the wiring as above to the ESP (Most GPIO pins can be used for the Signal/DQ/Yellow pin - we&rsquo;ll use GPIO5 for our example below (Pin D1 on a Nodemcu)</p>
<p>Add this to the ESPHome yaml;</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code># GPIO
one_wire:
  - platform: gpio
    pin: GPIO5</code></pre></div>
<p>And run <code>esphome run MyESPFile.yaml</code> and wait until it boots and starts producing logs.</p>
<p>Inside the logs, assuming the physical connection is good, ESPHome will discover all devices on the one-wire bus, like so:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>[20:59:28][C][gpio.one_wire:022]: GPIO 1-wire bus:
[20:59:28][C][gpio.one_wire:023]:   Pin: GPIO14
[20:59:28][C][gpio.one_wire:084]:   Found devices:
[20:59:28][C][gpio.one_wire:086]:     0x9c01145eeabd4028 (DS18B20)
[20:59:28][C][gpio.one_wire:086]:     0xee012026de4a2428 (DS18B20)
[20:59:28][C][gpio.one_wire:086]:     0x0401202706051528 (DS18B20)
[20:59:28][C][captive_portal:089]: Captive Portal:</code></pre></div>
<p>These provide the unique ID of each temperature sensor and the model needed.</p>
<p>Now you have the information you need to re-edit the yaml and create the sensors properly, like so:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>sensor:
  # Dallas
  # Repeat for each sensor on this bus
  - platform: dallas_temp
    address: 0x9c01145eeabd4028
    name: &#34;Boiler Flow&#34;    
    update_interval: 30s
  - platform: dallas_temp
    address: 0xee012026de4a2428
    name: &#34;Hot Water Tank&#34;    
    update_interval: 30s</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="tips">Tips</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The DB18B20 sensor may have the ID printed on its label and you can create the sensor config on your first go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your Dallas bus has several sensors and you&rsquo;re unsure which sensor relates to which purpose, continue streaming logs after building it, and simply hold one in your hand (or mouth, or cup of ice) for a little while until its readings change. Then add a sticky label to its lead.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="connecting-the-onewire-bus-to-a-pc-not-for-esphome">Connecting the Onewire bus to a PC <em>(Not for ESPHome)</em></h3>
<p>You will need an adapter to connect your one-wire bus to your PC, such as  the <a href="https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS9490-DS9490R.pdf" rel="external" target="_blank">DS9490R</a></p>
<figure><img src="/home-automation/esphome/one-wire/DS9490R.jpg"
    alt="DS9490R" width="290px">
</figure>

<p>This can be connected to Home Assistant directly using it&rsquo;s native <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/onewire/" rel="external" target="_blank">1-wire integration</a> or, as I did (because the former wasn&rsquo;t available when I first set up one-wire), by using Linux&rsquo;s OWFS one-wire file system, and writing a script to read the values from the local file system and put them into a MariaDb database, from which HA would fetch the values. (Not a very elegant way, but it worked well for years!)</p>

<h1 id="keeping-zigbee-sensors-running-in-extreme-cold">Keeping Zigbee Sensors Running in Extreme Cold</h1>

<p>The Aqara (and other) Zigbee devices are great in almost every situation. But when using them in cold conditions, such as inside a freezer, the default CR2032 batteries don&rsquo;t last well, especially in subzero temperatures.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s really simple to adapt them to use the much larger and commonly available 18650 Lithium rechargable batteries. I&rsquo;ve had several of these batteries reporting the temperature of my freezer in around -20c for over a year without needing recharging – quite remarkable!</p>
<p>To compare that to a CR2032, which would last just a couple of days for unbranded batteries, and even &ldquo;Cold Formula&rdquo; Ever-Ready batteries would give up the ghost between one week and two months, and you see why this is a modification that&rsquo;s worth making, if just to avoid wasting lots of CR2032 and avoiding the environmental and safety costs associated.</p>
<p>One solution is simply to solder an 18650 battery holder onto the sensor itself. Both being single-cell lithium batteries, the voltages are identical at a nominal 3.2v but the capacity is dramatically different. The 18650 will often read up to 4.2v when freshly charged, but I&rsquo;ve found no issues with connecting that directly to these sensors.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t restricted to Aqara or temperature sensors. Anything that takes a CR2032 or CR2016 or any other 3.2v lithium battery can usually be adapted this way.</p>
<h3 id="things-needed">Things needed:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Zigbee/Zwave/whatever temperature/humidity/other sensor</li>
<li>An 186550 single battery holder (Cost around £1-2, eg, ebay, aliexpress). You can solder directly to the battery if you prefer.</li>
<li>A soldering iron and some solder.</li>
<li>A hot glue gun (optional) or some tape/zip tie/whatever to hold the two things together. The wires and solder connections aren&rsquo;t really strong enough to take any strain.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="process-difficulty-simple">Process (Difficulty: Simple)</h3>
<p>Take your sensor and uncover the battery compartment, removing the CR2032 battery.</p>

</p>
<p>Note the two metal contacts. The little one at the top on the edge is the <strong>POSITIVE</strong> contact. The larger one in the middle is the <strong>NEGATIVE</strong>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re ever unsure about which way these go, use a multi-meter to test the CR2032 battery. The larger surface on these is positive and often marked with a <code>+</code> sign. The smaller, back face is negative.</p>
<p><strong>Now check the battery holder and if necessary strip around 5mm of plastic back from the ends of the red and black wires;</strong></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to the electric connections, and now is a good change to test it still works</p>
<p>Fit a battery to the holder and quickly press the button on the sensor. This should result in a blue light. If it doesn&rsquo;t, or you small a burning electrical smell, remove the battery quickly and check which way you&rsquo;ve connected the wires. <em>(I&rsquo;ve done this myself and surprisingly the sensors seem to survive mis-polarity for a short interval)</em></p>
<p>If things look good, you can then try a longer press and hold to ensure it connects to your zigbee network.</p>

</p>
<p>If everything is good, then it&rsquo;s time to glue or tape the battery holder and sensor together. I love hot glue, it&rsquo;s messy and hurts when it gets on your skin, but very useful for stuff like this.</p>
<p>

<p>Because I&rsquo;m placing these in a freezer, I like to put them in a small ziplock bag to protect them a little from frost condensation. This may not be strictly necessary – these small devices are remarkably robust – but it doesn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>

</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve done that, you might want to create an Automation in your Home Assistant or other monitoring program that lets you know when the temperature raises above a certain temperature, say -5c.</p>
<p>Automations like this have notified me when someone&rsquo;s left the freezer door open, or it&rsquo;s been unplugged by accident, and even after several hours of a power cut.</p>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Freezer doors are usually made of steel and of course, this does affect the radio signal of Zigbee. However, in practice, I&rsquo;ve found that the signal still gets through in my environment. Zigbee does benefit from a few mains-powered devices dotted through the home which add as mesh repeaters and perhaps that&rsquo;s helped me out.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alternatively">Alternatively</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When I first did this, I placed the battery outside of the freezer to keep it warm, and ran the thin wires through the door seal. That worked okay, but out of curiousity I tried putting the whole thing inside and found that surprisingly, the battery lasted almost as long as being left outside in the warm. You could even use an external 3v power supply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use other types of temperature sensors. I&rsquo;ve used both one-wire DS18B20 temperature sensors and DHT11/22&rsquo;s by pushing the wire through the door seal.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-home-assistant-is-helping-heat-my-water-for-free-with-help-from-the-sun">How Home Assistant is helping heat my water for free (With help from the sun)</h1>

<p><em>(Free in third party energy costs, anyway)</em></p>
<h2 id="update-after-three-years">Update after three years</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not had to change or maintain <strong>any</strong> of this setup – everything has continued to work perfectly. Through the summer, a typical sunny day charges the 5.4kwh battery by about 11 AM, then heats the water and exports to the grid for another few hours before the hot water&rsquo;s heated. For our house of two, that meant the LPG boiler that normally heats the water stayed off through all of July and August, and most of June and September. Not bad for an investment of £85</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I had Solar panels fitted a month ago. At the time I discussed with the engineer about using excess to heat water, directly from the inverter. But there was no immersion heater fitted to my tank at that time, and the installer wasn&rsquo;t keen on adding that to the job.<em>(And having fitted it myself now, I totally understand why, fitting the element was a tank-out pig of a job that took most of a day)</em></p>
<p>But once the solar panels were fitted and generating power, I wasn’t entirely happy to see the excess being pushed back into the grid for nothing. (After much setting up and back and forth, I did start to be paid 5p per kwh, but as I pay them 33p for the same, I don&rsquo;t consider this a <em>great</em> deal)</p>
<p>Anyway, I scratched my head and came up with this system.</p>
<h2 id="items">Items:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Inverter and Battery and GivEnergy systems are integrated into my HA setup thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cdpuk/givenergy-local" rel="external" target="_blank">cdpuk&rsquo;s integration 11</a>, which works perfectly. This allows me to get all the stats I need into HA, and display them like this:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A low power 1kw 27″ top-mounted immersion element. Normal immersions are 3kw, which is more than I can generate to excess. 1kw is perfect for me. I fitted this to the tank (fiddly) and connected it to a 13a capable flex which connected to a standard UK 13a fused plug.</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>A TPLink MiniKasa smart socket. (wifi) The socket is rated for 13a and by choosing a low power immersion (they’re normally 3kw for fixed wiring) I’m keeping load on that around 5a at 230vac, and the switch is not getting warm. I would be more concerned about load with an unbranded or low quality switch. But even in a warm room, this is fine.</li>

<li>£5 for ancillaries (socket, wiring, sensor, tea)</li>
<li>£7,700 for the solar install <em>(ahem)</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="controlling-things">Controlling things</h2>
<p>This just needs two very simple automations</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the solar system is sending &gt;1200 watts to the grid for more than 5 minutes and the temperature of the tank is &lt;60c:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn <strong>on</strong> socket feeding the immersion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If sending &lt;1000w to the grid for more than 3 minutes <strong>or</strong> temp &gt;65c:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn <strong>off</strong> socket feeding the immersion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="safety">Safety:</h2>
<p>Some things to consider if you fancy doing something similar.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is a traditional UK Y-Plan <strong>vented</strong> hot water system. It&rsquo;s fed by an unpressurised cold water tank in the loft, so there is little risk of explosion should the water get too hot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My tank didn&rsquo;t have space to insert the heating element in-situ, so I needed to drain and remove it. Even then, the top nut was very stiff and difficult to remove.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be competent at mains wiring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose an immersion element with dual thermostats. One of these should be set by the factory, the second is where you set the target temperature. Once either is reached, it will cut power into the element regardless of the switch. This system is independent of HA and any automation - that&rsquo;s important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build in as many safeguards as you can. For example, I have a tertiary automation that turns off the switch if it happens to be on at sunset, when there&rsquo;s no chance of any more free power. This is a safety precaution, but also a cost one. Electricity from the mains is expensive - I don&rsquo;t want that to be heating my water by accident!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s working great. The water gets hotter</p>
<h2 id="result">Result</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s working great. The system satisfies my house hot water needs entirely on any sunny day (in Winter too). My LPG boiler doesn&rsquo;t get used in the summer, although it&rsquo;s still connected and will step in if the water drops too low during its own schedule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to estimate the cost saving, but it certainly repays the investment several times a year.  (That&rsquo;s this project, not the whole solar install!)</p>

<h1 id="using-gpslogger-for-traccar">Using Gpslogger for Traccar</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.traccar.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">Traccar</a> is an amazing piece of free, open source software to track GPS devices and people.</p>
<p>However, I had trouble getting accurate results through its Traccar Client Android app – it would report positions miles away from where I was, and a journey was logged with very strange results indeed. However, GPSLogger already running on the same device was extremely accurate.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I&rsquo;ve since learned that changing Traccar&rsquo;s client to &lsquo;High Sensitivity&rsquo; does fix most of the inaccuracies, but I still preferred GPSLogger which could also record a local GPX and upload to Gdrive at the same time</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I decided to use GPSLogger&rsquo;s Custom URL feature to use that to update Traccar, and skip using the dedicated client entirely. This also meant one less app running on my phone, as I use GPSLogger to automatically create GPX files of my journeys.</p>
<p>So – how to use GPSLogger to report your position to your own Traccar server. I found this to be very accurate and well behaved.</p>
<h3 id="references">References:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.traccar.org/osmand/" rel="external" target="_blank">Traccar documentation for OSMAN type URL paramaters</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gpslogger.app/images/17b.png" rel="external" target="_blank">GPSLogger&rsquo;s parameter reference (Parent)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps">Steps:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Have a publically accessible URL for your Traccar server.
<em>I host Traccar on my private server behind a CGNat, and use a free Cloudflare tunnel to allow remote access to it.
Eg: <code>https://tracserver.domain.com</code></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install GPSLogger onto your phone
Note: It&rsquo;s not on play.com, so you&rsquo;ll need to use <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.mendhak.gpslogger/" rel="external" target="_blank">FDroid</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mendhak/gpslogger/" rel="external" target="_blank">install manually via APK</a> – see the <a href="https://gpslogger.app/" rel="external" target="_blank">GPSLogger site</a> for details</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In GPSLogger, Set your Logging Details up as you want and then navigate to <code>Auto Send, email and upload</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section should be left unset for Traccar, but if you&rsquo;re also sending a GPX file to GDrive or elsewhere, you may already have settings here. Just ensure <code>Custom URL</code> in this section is NOT ticked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return to the GPSLogger setting menu and select <code>Custom URL</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tick <code>Log to custom URL</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UNTICK <code>Allow Auto Sending</code> (otherwise it will repeatedly send the same coords to traccar until it floods out a few hours later)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also leave <code>Discard offline locations</code> unticked. This way if your connection fails, GPSlogger will keep recording and send those logs to Traccar once network is restored, so you can a decent history log even offline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <code>URL</code>, put the following, but change</p>
<p>a) <strong>TRACCAR_URL</strong> to your public URL. If you have a specific port you need to use, specify that after the URL and BEFORE the following slash. Eg: <code>…COM:5505/</code></p>
<p>b) The <strong>ID</strong> to match the ID of your user in Traccar. (Change YOUR_ID to that number)</p>
<p><code>https://TRACCAR_URL/?id=YOUR_ID&amp;lat=%LAT&amp;lon=%LON&amp;hdop=1&amp;altitude=%ALT&amp;speed=%SPD&amp;batt=%BATT&amp;timestamp=%TIMESTAMP&amp;charge=%ISCHARGING&amp;bearing=%DIR</code></p>
<p>You can play around with the parameters as per the references above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Important! Under <code>HTTP Method</code>, set this from <code>GET</code> to <code>POST</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back out and click <code>Start Logging</code>. If everything is good, then you should see GPSLogger issuing http requests in its Logging page. Soon after, you&rsquo;ll see your device start to update on the Traccar map.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>GPSLogger shows a small blue circle at the top right of its menu when it&rsquo;s sending and the device should be updated a few seconds after that, at whatever upload frequency you set.</li>
<li>You can also watch the logs in Traccar on the server by doing something like: <code>tail -f /opt/traccar/logs/tracker-server.log</code></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="measuring-freezer-temperatures">Measuring Freezer Temperatures</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="/home-automation/zigbee-sensors-in-the-cold/index.html">Please also read my article about keeping Zigbee and other battery devices running in sub-zero temperatures</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Or dealing with battery failure in minus twenty degrees.</em></p>
<p>Some years ago, I filled one of my freezers with frozen meat for my dogs and forgot to turn it on. My dogs helpfully reminded me three weeks later when it started oozing liquid out through the door. Finding a home for 80kg of rotted meat in open plastic bags was one of the less fun jobs I’ve had, and trying to prevent this happening again drove me to start monitoring their temperatures.</p>
<p>I currently use two methods to measure these temperatures, and have an Automation that alerts me whenever one of the temperatures goes above -5c. This should alert me if I’ve forgotten to turn it on again, as well as freezer failure or someone leaving the door open. With the average cost of a freezer’s contents being over £100, it seems like a sensible thing to do and over the years has alerted us to several non-closed doors.</p>
<h1 id="method-1-onewire">Method 1: Onewire</h1>
<p>One method I use is to add a Onewire sensor inside a freezer by poking a small hole in the door seal by the hinges and shoving a waterproof DS18B20 sensor inside – like this:</p>
<p>

</ul>
<h2 id="cons">Cons:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The need to poke a hole in the door seal.<em>(If you have some flat wire, you can avoid this by just closing the seal over it)</em></li>
<li>Fixed wiring. This might be unsightly and time consuming to fit. I’ve used it where I had an existing Onewire run nearby.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="method-2-zigbee-temperature-sensors">Method 2: Zigbee Temperature Sensors</h1>
<p>Wireless temperature sensors like the Aqara are cheap, reasonably accurate and small. If you have Zigbee already, then I would suggest using these.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>These use CR2032 button batteries. In normal, room-temperature, situations these last for up to a year. However, in a freezer at -20, I’ve had good, branded batteries fail after 3 days!</p>
<p>To overcome this, I’ve modified my sensors to use 18650 rechargable batteries by connecting wires to the battery compartment in the Aqara that go to a battery holder. That can be in the freezer with the sensor, making a very portable little unit – or, with longer wires, outside of the freezer to stay warmer.</p>
<p>

<p>Whilst the room-temperature version should last longer, in practice I have found little difference in lifespan. Both last at least six months before needing recharging.</p>

<p>Incidentally, it’s no big surprise that range is affected in these low-power sensors by putting them inside a big metal box! However, they still reach across my house to my Slae.sh Zigbee usb stick and reliability has been excellent.</p>
<h2 id="pros-1">Pros:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Neater and quicker to install.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cons-1">Cons:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Less regular updates – these sensors only send a reading when the temperature changes. However, in practice this is a non-problem since the freezer is always cycling and updates are adequate.</li>
<li>Still a need to replace batteries.</li>
<li>Potential range issues when inside a freezer.</li>

<p>If any of my five sensors go above -5c, then send myself a message over Telegram and run a Shell command (This plays a .wav file to a speaker that tells the house that a freezer is over temperature)</p>

<p>And finally – apparently having five freezers is unusual! I have been told this!</p>

<p>Just some cool ideas for automation if you&rsquo;re looking for inspiration, or justifying why Home Automation can be useful.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-night-lights">Automatic Night Lights</h2>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Like many people into their middle age, I sometimes need to visit the toilet at night. Turning on lights and remembering to turn them off wasn&rsquo;t the biggest deal in the world, but I thought it woke my brain up just a little bit more than it needed.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Create a system that detects movement and turns on lights to the most common areas.</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>In Home Assistant:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using various existing movement sensors (From the original Burglar Alarm, combined with a couple of Aqara Zigbee PIR sensors, and all the door sensors; detect movement</li>
<li>If the time is between Sunset and Sunrise, turn on some lights. Wait five minutes and then turn them back off. If more movement is detected, reset the timer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Even Better:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The automations work by time. After 10PM when we&rsquo;re more likely to be going to bed, the same automation applies but only sets the lights at 5%. This is just bright enough to see by.</li>
<li>These are better than standalone &ldquo;movement lights&rdquo; because:
<ul>
<li>They never run out of battery.</li>
<li>They can be linked in many creative ways depending where that movement is detected. For example: Front door opens? We probably want most lights on. But if it&rsquo;s bedroom movement at night, chances are it&rsquo;s just the hall and bathroom that are needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="monitoring-freezer-temperatures">Monitoring Freezer Temperatures</h2>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> What happens if a freezer is unplugged or breaks down when it&rsquo;s full of food, and you don&rsquo;t notice it immediately?</p>
<p><strong>History:</strong> We used to feed our dogs on a raw meat diet. That meant buying a lot of meat, all packages in 500g plastic bags and kept in a half-sized freezer in the house. It was actually the overflow dog food freezer so had been left turned off before hand. We had a delivery that filled the primary freezer so I put the overflow in this one. 30kg of raw meat. What I didn&rsquo;t do, was turn the freezer back on&hellip;  A fortnight later, we noticed the dogs were sniffing at the freezer and licking it, and when I opened it, rotting meat fell out. Cleaning that up was not a fun game&hellip; (Fortunately we had a farmer friend who was able to dispose of the meat, but we still had to remove and bag it up to get it outside, then do a big cleanup job. Quite an incentive to prevent it re-occurring, right?</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Monitor the internal temperature of each freezer (We had five at one point) and raise alerts if any of them went above -5&rsquo;c</p>
