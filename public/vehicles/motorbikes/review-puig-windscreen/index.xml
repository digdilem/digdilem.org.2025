    <title>(Honest) Review of Puig Touring Windscreen for the Royal Enfield Himalayan :: Digital Dilemma</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/vehicles/motorbikes/review-puig-windscreen/index.html</link>
    <description>I bought it but I put the original back after only one ride…&#xA;The stock 2023 Himalayan is a great bike, but head and body wind protection is pretty minimal. Having come from a BMW R1200GS with an amazing Givi Airflow screen, I missed being able to ride with an open helmet at everything other than motorway speeds, so went shopping.&#xA;The only really affordable option I found was the Puig Touring screen, available Clear, tinted or smoked. So I paid £110 to the cheapest decent ebay supplier and bought it. It turned up a few days later, not very well packaged but was undamaged and still in original packaging.</description>
