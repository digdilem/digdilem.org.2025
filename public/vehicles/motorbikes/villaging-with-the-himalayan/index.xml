    <title>Villaging With the Himalayan :: Digital Dilemma</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/vehicles/motorbikes/villaging-with-the-himalayan/index.html</link>
    <description>I like to ride for pleasure at least once a week, but have been getting a bit bored with riding the same roads and lanes. I’m fortunate to have some beautiful countryside nearby (Dartmoor – I’m in England) but even so, it’s a bit repetitive eventually.&#xA;My solution to this ‘problem’ is to set myself a target – to take my Himalayan to every Village in my home county of Devon.</description>
