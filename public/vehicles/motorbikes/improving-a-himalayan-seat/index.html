<h1 id="improving-a-himalayan-seat">Improving a Himalayan Seat</h1>

<p>I love my Himalayan, but the seat is not its best feature. It&rsquo;s hard, strangely narrow and angles forwards. Not only giving you a numb and then increasingly painful rear end after a time riding, but also squishing your gentleman&rsquo;s equipment against the fuel tank.</p>
<p>My first attempt to fix this was the buy the genuine Royal Enfield “Touring seat” for £70.80. It&rsquo;s an easy swap – just remove the old and slip in the new. But, amazingly, I couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference! It felt exactly the same. It wasn&rsquo;t made the same; it was open underneath and there was a different mesh where it was solid in the other, but it was just as hard and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I tried with various seat-toppers. That helped a bit, as did a Sheepskin, but I needed 2 or 3 before I could ride more than an hour without a break, which left me teetering on layers of unconnected foam like the Princess and the Pea.</p>
<p>I also tried using my bicycling underwear. That was surprisingly good. Then I heard about Moto Skiveez – basically the same thing but with pads specifically for adventure riding. I bought some of those. Those were a little bit better and well made, but absolutely NOT worth the <strong>£62.50</strong> I paid for them! They are good pants, but not ten times better than basic cycling padded pants, which is what they cost. I consider Moto Skiveez to be 10% good product, 90% marketing.</p>
<p>So, figuring I might as well hack the original seat around a bit. If I messed things up, I still had the Touring seat.</p>
<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<ul>
<li>I bought a 2cm thick gel pad off Amazon for £25, watched some Youtube videos, and got to work.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion--was-it-worth-it">Conclusion – was it worth it?</h2>
<p>Yeeeess…? Probably? Maybe?</p>
<p>The seat <em>is</em> more comfortable. I&rsquo;ll ride a good couple of hours (I&rsquo;m a heavy bloke with a skinny bum so I&rsquo;ll take extra padding every time). I did still wear a sheepskin over the saddle.</p>
<p>What would I do differently? I&rsquo;m not sure the gel pad made much difference – maybe I buried it too low so its shaping qualities were lost. So perhaps if you do the same, consider your needs a little better than I did.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Update 2025: 2 years on</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst my modification <em>was</em> better than the original, it still wasn&rsquo;t ideal. I stripped everything back one rainy day and set-to again, focusing on much more foam. More! More! I&rsquo;d bought a waterproof seat cover for something else, and once I&rsquo;d added a big square of foam (from a car seat booster cushion), the original cover would no longer fit - but the extra one did. So now I finally have a comfortable seat that I can ride for 3-4 hours without feeling uncomfortable. It doesn&rsquo;t look good, but I&rsquo;d need professional help and a new properly fitted cover to achieve that. Upholstery is hard!</p>
