    <title>Himalayan: Fitting a 16t Sprocket :: Digital Dilemma</title>
    <link>https://digdilem.org/vehicles/motorbikes/fitting-16t-sprocket/index.html</link>
    <description>A 16t sprocket suitable for Himalayan and Scram motorbikes&#xA;The Reasoning One of the most popular modifications for the Royal Enfield Himalayan is to replace the front drive sprocket which changes the gearing through all gears.&#xA;The stock Himalayan is fitted with a 15-tooth (15t) front sprocket which takes drive from the engine onto the chain. This provides reasonable gearing for the 24.5bhp for a wide variety of riding surfaces, but as the bike only has five gears, this means that top-end speed is undergeared, and to achieve motorway/highway speeds you must push the engine into the 5k to 6k range (70mph indicated = 5800rpm for my tests on stock tyres, level road). As the engine redlines at a low 6000 this means a lot of noise, vibration and engine wear to keep up with traffic.</description>
