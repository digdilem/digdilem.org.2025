<h1 id="honest-review-of-puig-touring-windscreen-for-the-royal-enfield-himalayan">(Honest) Review of Puig Touring Windscreen for the Royal Enfield Himalayan</h1>

<p><em>I bought it but I put the original back after only one ride…</em></p>
<p>The stock 2023 Himalayan is a great bike, but head and body wind protection is pretty minimal. Having come from a BMW R1200GS with an amazing Givi Airflow screen, I missed being able to ride with an open helmet at everything other than motorway speeds, so went shopping.</p>
<p>The only really affordable option I found was the Puig Touring screen, available Clear, tinted or smoked. So I paid £110 to the cheapest decent ebay supplier and bought it. It turned up a few days later, not very well packaged but was undamaged and still in original packaging.</p>
<p>Fitting was simple – screens are held on with four small bolts and it’s just a case of unscrewing them and putting them back on. I have an accessory bar also sharing these holes for my phone, but that doesn’t affect mounting at all.</p>
<p>Here’s what it looked like when mounted:</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3 id="problem-1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>I was happy with that, but I had noticed that the screen moves a lot. That wide bit acts like a natural hinge and despite the plastic being reasonably thick, I could move the top of the screen back with my finger and very little pressure about an inch.</p>
<h3 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h3>
<p>So I hopped on and put the bike on full lock as I turned to leave my home. The mirrors hit the screen! I will admit that my left mirror is on an extension bar, but the right hand mirror is entirely stock. BOTH mirrors hit the screen at full lock. This is terrible! Not only does it risk damaging the screen. Not only did it push one mirror back out of alignment. But it’s also dangerous for it to interfere with the steering. That’s a part of the MOT check for British bikes so it could actually fail a safety inspection.</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3 id="problem-3">Problem 3</h3>
<p>I’m 6’2″ tall, so I expected some buffetting on the stock screen. Somehow, this taller screen actually made that worse! It redirected air that was previously hitting me in the chest and pointed it right at my head, increasing buffetting. It actually lowered the speed where I closed my visor from around 40mph to 30mph, and I didn’t need any lunch after an hour’s riding because I’d eaten so many flies!</p>
<p>So, in all, a very disappointing purchase. I replaced the original screen as soon as I got back from that ride.</p>

<h1 id="selling-my-dream-motorbike">Selling My Dream Motorbike</h1>

<p>The TV Program, <code>Long Way Round</code> was what made me want a motorbike, and specifically a BMW GS. In my mid 40s and facing a mid life crisis, I decided to do bikes. I wanted to travel the world too. It looked cool, it looked fun, it looked interesting.</p>
<p>So I did my CBT (Uk basic test), bought a £300 Chinese 125 and rode through the winter to get some miles in. Then booked the DAS test (same as the EU bike test – it’s tough) and then went to a bike showroom and ended up buying a high-mileage 2004 BMW R1200GS with full luggage – even before I passed my test. Luckily I did pass and loved riding it.</p>
<p>But as I grew in experience, I began to think that it might not be the bike for me.</p>
<p>It was complicated. First the ABS pump died, and there’s lots of horror stories about that with the early BMWs. It knocked my confidence back a bit (as it died it fought back, releasing brakes at the wrong time, and pulsing heavily on corners. ) I had the ABS bypassed by a mechanic, and the brakes were brilliant after that. But I lived in fear of further problems. Clutch slipping? Oh no, that needs the bike splitting in half to replace! Rear bearing feel a bit sloppy? That needs a week in the workshop too. The alternator did seize, and I managed to replace that myself quite cheaply, but it was a big thing for me to do – I’m no mechanic.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>But the main problem I had was – it’s too damned big and too damned heavy. I lived in fear of riding down a narrow lane and meeting a tractor. Trying to turn that lump around by myself downhill gave me sleepless nights. (Don’t tell me I could just spin the back wheel or pivot on the side-stand, I’m not that good a rider and these lanes have grass in the middle)</p>
<p>Then I saw the Royal Enfield Himalayan and loved its looks. I went to the local dealer and did a test ride. It was everything the GS was not – light (it’s not actually that light, but by comparison), very nimble and flickable, and is superb off road even on the stock tyres. Turning into my road there’s a patch of gravel that always made the GS slide the front wheel and tighten my sphincter. The Himmie doesn’t even notice it. I found myself driving up the middle bit of the lanes, full of mud and stones.The Enfield finds grip EVERYWHERE. So I rode back to the dealer and said &quot; &ldquo;When can I have one?&rdquo; &quot; &ldquo;Three days if you pick a colour we’ve got in stock”. &quot; &ldquo;Good, let’s do that then.”</p>
<p>I’ve owned the Himalayan for a little over three months. I’ve put a thousand miles on it – the average annual mileage I put on the GS in the past four years. I did the first service, I adjusted the valves. I enjoy maintaining it, working on it. It’s simple honest engineering that’s designed to do a job.</p>
<p>I’m now searching out green lanes and exploring my local county as much as I can, really enjoying the simple pleasure of just riding along roads without a destination in mind. &quot; &ldquo;Oh, that looks like an interesting road, let’s go there”</p>
<p>So the GS goes on eBay and I’ve just loaded it into a van to go to its next owner. I hope they enjoy it, it really is a nice bike. On the motorway it’s excellent, and the power for overtaking is superb. But I’ve often felt like I had to apologise to it for not being a better rider. I’ve been scared of it several times, I’ve never even pinned the throttle back all the way, and been startled by corners coming up way faster than I expected. I never once went off road because I think that to handle that much weight and power away from the tarmac, you need to be a very good rider.</p>
<p>There’s little comparison between the two bikes. The Himalayan is a little tractor that will go absolutely anywhere, and it gives back a huge amount of confidence to the rider.</p>
<p>The GS is a big, powerful German who wants to run up every hill and is disappointed if you don’t want to just nip across two countries and be back in time for tea. The Himalayan is a big friendly dog that is your best childhood friend and wants to do whatever you want to. It doesn’t judge you and it doesn’t feel bad if you just want to ride at 20mph along Devon lanes for an hour or two.</p>
<p>For me, the joy of riding is about the ride. It’s not about getting somewhere, so who cares if it’s slower? More time to look and and appreciate the countryside.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Update, November 2023:</strong></p>
<p>Eight months of owning the Himalayan, and I’ve put 3,000 miles on it – more than I put on the GS in four years of ownership. And those are not motorway miles – the Himalayan is no trans-continental autobahn beast, it’s a plodder. Most of those miles are done at 20-40mph in narrow lanes as I explore my county of Devon. I’ve even done quite a few green lanes by myself, and joined the TRF to learn more about trials riding. (And learned that a Himalayan is not quite the tool of choice!) It suits me and I still like it a lot.</p>
<p>I’ve done the first service, including valve checks. It’s a very easy bike to work on and quite simple. It’s well made – all bolts are stainless steel, the frame’s strong. Maybe the engine light has a tendency to come on at the slightest excuse but you can generally ignore it if the bike sounds ok, and it’ll turn itself back off again after a while.</p>
<p>The new Himalayan 452 has been launched elsewhere, and it’s an interesting bike. I can certainly see why many people are interested in the increase of power. But I’m going to stick with my 411 and it’s 24.5 hp for a while longer, I think.</p>
<p>** Update, June 2025**</p>
<p>The Himalayan is up to 7,000 miles now and I still love it. It&rsquo;s a well built and reliable machine.</p>
<p>Problems I have had:</p>
<ul>
<li>Royal Enfield Battery died. I&rsquo;d had a lot of low voltage warnings and after 3 starts during a service, it refused to crank. I replaced with a cheap SLA 12AH battery costing £29 and have not had another warning light since. (I do keep it on a battery tender when not in use, which does help)</li>
<li>Wouldn&rsquo;t start after I&rsquo;d been fitting a pair of dashcams. Turns out I&rsquo;d pulled a wire out of the fuel pump connector through being heavy handed. 100% my fault and I managed to repair it.</li>
<li>A puncture on the first ride after I&rsquo;d replaced the rear tyre myself. Yep - my fault again. I&rsquo;d pinched the inner tube!</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion: Royal Enfield make good bikes that are reliable and affordable.</p>

</p>
<h3 id="the-reasoning">The Reasoning</h3>
<p>One of the most popular modifications for the Royal Enfield Himalayan is to replace the front drive sprocket which changes the gearing through all gears.</p>
<p>The stock Himalayan is fitted with a 15-tooth (15t) front sprocket which takes drive from the engine onto the chain. This provides reasonable gearing for the 24.5bhp for a wide variety of riding surfaces, but as the bike only has five gears, this means that top-end speed is undergeared, and to achieve motorway/highway speeds you must push the engine into the 5k to 6k range (70mph indicated = 5800rpm for my tests on stock tyres, level road). As the engine redlines at a low 6000 this means a lot of noise, vibration and engine wear to keep up with traffic.</p>
<p>For only £17 and an hour’s time, I was able to change this sprocket to a 16-tooth one which has resulted in a much nicer highway experience, and as I spend most of my time riding on tarmac, this was a good solution for me.</p>
<p>Should you do this? If you do a lot of road riding, particularly above 50mph, I would say yes, definitely. If you mostly ride on dirt, or narrow tracks, best to keep it as it was designed.</p>

I bought mine here for £16.63 and it arrived in two days. It appears to be a common part between many Royal Enfield bikes, and this one was advertised for the Interceptor. It’s made by the German company ESJOT and is good quality. I think it will last just as long as the original. (Disclaimer: I receive no benefit from either company mentioned. I paid for the part as a regular customer and have no ongoing relationship with them.)</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="tools">Tools</h6>
<ul>
<li>A metric socket set. I also found a breaker bar useful to loosen the main sprocket nut.</li>
<li>12mm spanner to loose chain adjusters. (There’s one in the bike’s toolkit)</li>
<li>A hammer and screwdriver or punch to flatten the soft metal locking tab, and reset it afterwards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="process">Process</h3>
<p>I’ll describe it here, and there are good guides by other people if you need on Youtube: by Unfastened :: By Two Wheels Ben</p>
<p>Note: At 1500 miles, my bike’s original chain was sufficiently run-in that the original chain worked fine. Others have reported that you may need an extra link, or 112-link chain. I would suggest trying this anyway, reverting it is easy enough if you find you do need a longer chain, and you won’t be left without a bike. You don’t need to remove or split the chain to replace this sprocket, although if you’re doing both sprockets you may find it easier, especially if also replacing the chain.</p>
<p><strong>How I did it:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Put bike on centre stand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loosen main rear wheel bolt, and loosen both 12mm lock nuts to adjust the chain. Slacken the chain fully and push the rear wheel forwards to give the chain as much slack as you can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the two 8mm bolts on the sprocket cover (Front of chain) and remove cover.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a punch or screwdriver, flatten the soft and shiny washer behind the main nut – it will have a tab folded over to stop the main nut undoing. Just unfold it enough so the nut will turn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the correct socket, undo the main nut. (It’s a normal right-hand thread)</p>
<p>Hint: To stop the wheel turning, I went to the other side of the bike and pushed down the rear brake with my foot. Then, leaning over the bike, I used an extension bar to gain the leverage to undo the nut. It’s on tight!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the nut and soft washer, noting which way they’re facing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now remove the old sprocket. This is most easily done by sliding it out with the chain still around it. It should come off fairly easily as you’ve slackened the chain. Once off the bolt, you can unroll it from the chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare the old and new sprockets. The new one should be similar and fit the chain well. The writing should face towards you to help identify it once fitted, but the sprocket appears to be bi-directional. The original sprocket has a bonded plastic facing, which I think is for noise deadening, so they won’t look that similar – but it doesn’t make any difference to the fitting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fit the new sprocket into the chain and fit it over the drive bolt. This will probably be a snug fit, and you may need to use something to lever against the frame to persuade it home (don’t use anything metal or you may damage the frame and sprocket)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once located, rotate the wheel to ensure the chain is well seated and turns freely, and that there is adequate slack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refit the shiny washer in the same direction it came off, and refit the nut. Tighten the nut well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a screwdriver, bend the shiny washer up to stop the nut undoing – making it as it was before you began.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refit the sprocket cover with the two 8mm bolts. Warning: Soft bolts, do not overtighten!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tighten the chain to normal levels, and secure the locking nuts and main wheel bolt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a cup of tea.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-results">The Results</h3>
<p><strong>Normal Riding</strong></p>
<p>Not a huge amount of difference to be felt, it’s only a 7% or so ratio difference after all. I found it felt more like a normal road focused motorbike. Gear changes feel the same, no more or less vibration. The only thing I found was that I was more likely to bog the bike at low revs as I’d gotten used to changing up earlier. After just half an hour of riding, I’d got used to it though.</p>
<p><strong>Narrow lanes</strong></p>
<p>I live on Dartmoor on the UK and we have a lot of very bendy, narrow (less than 3m) tarmac roads set deep within high banks. Typical speed on these is around 20mph as visibility is low. Before, I was riding these in 2nd or 3rd and after fitting the sprocket, more often in 2nd but almost as often in 3rd, and keeping the same speed. No big difference here.</p>
<p><strong>Faster single carriageway roads (A and B classification)</strong></p>
<p>More noticable here, the Himalayan feels more normally geared. Progress is better, and overall slightly faster. There’s more of a speed difference between gear changes, perhaps I was holding on for another 5 or 10mph before changing up to 3rd or 4th. Before changing the sprocket, I would often ride these in 5th, but after I was more often in 4th, only changing up when I got about 45mph or higher. Before, I could easily leave it in 5th from 30mph onwards if riding lazily.</p>
<p><strong>Motorway / Highway (70mph legal limit, riding at 55+)</strong></p>
<p>This is where the modification really pays off and you will feel its benefits.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, I’d ridden back from Cornwall, which included a 90 minute stretch of the A30 which was running clear. At 60mph, there was noticeable noise and vibration and mechanical sympathy stopped me going to 70mph for more than brief overtaking spells. Even that relatively brief time left me with mild tinnitus, despite wearing earplugs and using the stock exhaust.</p>
<p>A test ride on the motorway after fitting this was much more relaxed, able to comfortably cruise at 65-70 with some power left in reserve for overtakes and hills, although steep hills will undoubtedly require a visit to 4th gear. I’m 6’2″ and 110kg, so it can support larger riders at this speed too. Whilst the Himalayan could do these speeds with a 15t as well, it ran out of RPMs way before it ran out of power. The bike itself is stable and comfortable at 70mph on a non-windy day.</p>
<p>Here’s the actual figures as I recall them.</p>
<p><em>Note: The Himalayan speedometer over-reads by around 5% (confirmed by GPS), and these speeds are from that, so actuals will be slightly lower. However, they are consistent enough for useful comparison.</em></p>

<h3 id="pros-and-cons">Pros and Cons</h3>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quieter, less vibration. Overall more comfortable cruising.</li>
<li>More able to comfortably stay at 70mph.</li>
<li>Less engine wear</li>
<li>Better fuel economy</li>
<li>Easily reversed.</li>
<li>Cheap and immediately effective.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A taller first gear, losing some of the Himalayan’s tractor-like crawling ability at slow speeds.</li>
<li>The original lower gearing may be preferred by those who do mostly off-road, trail or mountainous riding, plus those who ride in cities as a commuter or who carry heavy loads.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h6>
<p>Like every modification one does to a vehicle, it’s a compromise that won’t suit every use-case. Motorbike manufacturers spent a lot of time and effort making the best bike they can for the money and original equipment is often the best for most riders. But things like gearing are a compromise, and this is especially true where we riders choose to use a bike designed for climbing mountains as a daily runabout on flat 70mph tarmac, so where we can adapt it to better suit our specific needs, it can be good to do so.</p>
<p>For under £20 and an hour’s time, you can easily improve your Himalayan’s on-road performance. It’s not surprising that this is one of the most common modifications that Himalayan owners perform. Even if a new chain was required, I think the cost is easily justified if you do any amount of highway work.</p>
<p>If you are not mechanically inclined, then any workshop will be able to do this for you if you supply them with the new sprocket.</p>

<h1 id="honest-review-of-oxford-heated-grips-for-the-royal-enfield-himalayan">(Honest) Review of Oxford Heated grips for the Royal Enfield Himalayan</h1>

</p>
<p>I’m a huge fan of heated grips, having discovered them on my GS. When I was learning to ride a bike, I rode through the winter on a Sinnis Cafe 125 and often got so cold I’d have to pull over and warm my hands on the engine – sometimes every 2 or 3 miles. My circulation isn’t the best thanks to beta blockers, and that also means I get vibration numbness fairly quickly when it’s cold – so I pretty much consider grips a necessity for riding in the UK 3/4 of the year.</p>
<p>Oxford are a well known manufacturer of self-install grips, and as my new Himalayan came without such pleasures, I bought a set of their Adventure grips for £60 in 2023 and installed them.</p>
<p>I bought these with my own money and I receive no benefit for this review, nor am I linked to the manufacturer in any way. This is my honest opinion.</p>
<h3 id="so-whats-the-verdict">So, what’s the verdict?</h3>
<p><strong>Overall: 9.5/10</strong></p>
<p>Very good. Strongly recommended if you ride anywhere even slightly cold.</p>
<p><strong>Value: 8/10</strong></p>
<p>£59.99 (UK, Q1 2023) for well made, robust and weatherproof grips and controller seems like a very good price to me, and that’s someone who is not afraid to scour the internet to buy cheap. I bought these from Amazon.</p>
<p><strong>Quality: 9/10</strong></p>
<p>Good to very good. The grips are a little softer than the Himalayan’s original ones, which is fine – although I imagine they will wear through within several years. They’re very grippy as a result, which is good, and you don’t need to hold them as tight.</p>
<p>The controller is well sealed, very clear to use (pic above, it’s the box marked ‘Oxford’) and very simple to operate with one thumb without taking your eyes off the road. At the time of writing we’re close to Winter and I’m using them most trips.</p>
<p><strong>Heat: 9/10</strong></p>
<p>They’re not immediately hot, taking perhaps 2-3 minutes to warm up enough to feel through your gloves. But once up, they keep the set temperature very smoothly and I could detect no “modulation” where they get alternatingly hot and cold. The 5 settings are well spaced and I tend to use the 40%, 50% and 75% settings most. 100% is too hot for anything above sub zero temperatures, but it’s good to know it’s there if you need it.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions: 7/10</strong></p>
<p>Fairly typical “Few sheets of paper” installation instructions. Perhaps a little light if you’re unfamiliar with electrics or working on your bike, and you might want to seek some help. I do know people who have paid mechanics to fit these and that’s definitely an option.</p>
<p>I did disagree quite strongly with the instructions on one item, which is that they tell you to connect these straight to the battery (they include an inline fuse). This means you need to turn them off manually every time you stop, or they’ll stay on. This obviously uses the battery power and I believe will cause you starting problems if you do leave them on, especially in cold weather. As a protection, they say these will automatically turn off when the voltage drops to 11.5v, but I think that’s far too low and some bikes will struggle to start at that voltage. I used a switched-live relay to fit mine, which turns them off with the bike. That means you need to remember to turn them back on again, but auto-off is a small price to pay to be able to start your bike! I’ll detail that further below.</p>
<p><strong>Fitting: 9/10</strong></p>
<p>The whole fitting process took me a couple of easy hours with a couple of stops for tea and pondering. It’s well within the capabilities of most people, but if you’re unsure, stop and research before continuing.</p>
<p>**Step 1: Removing the stock grips. **</p>
<p>I slit mine open with a sharp knife – they’re glued, so sliding them off didn’t work, but if you’re more patient you may succeed where I failed.</p>
<p>*<em>Step 2: Fitting the new grips.</em></p>
<p>Ensuring you use the <code>R</code> and <code>L</code> grips appropriately, fit and glue them in place. I used superglue which has held up well.
Note: Be careful how you position the throttle side cable. I know someone who broke down because his glue failed and the grip slowly rotated until each time he let go of the throttle, the cable pressed against the bike’s kill switch which, as you can see in the top photo, is very easily crossed by the cable. His bike then stopped and it took a while for him to figure out why… The positioning in my photo has worked well for me but you should experiment to find what’s best for you and your bike.</p>
<p>**Step 3: Fitting the controller. **</p>
<p>I put mine on the left hand side where I can use my left thumb, but positioning is entirely personal. You may need a little fettling to expand the supplied bracket’s holes as I did, which I’ve protected with a clumsy blob of paint as in this picture:</p>
<p>

</figure>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: The wiring.</strong></p>
<p>Each grip connects to the controller with a nicely sealed plug and socket, and can be tidied away with zip ties, ensuring you have enough flex to turn the bars without straining anything. Then there’s just one cable to connect to your power source or relay.</p>
<p><strong>Where to connect to the power:</strong> I strongly, STRONGLY, recommend using a fused, switched live to power these grips.</p>
<p>Tip: Since I fitted mine, I’ve heard of a chap who took a supply from the horn feed, which he says is switched live and fused. (I have not verified this) That would certainly be easier than my method if so, and worth you checking. It also saves a good bit of cable tidying as it’s at the right end of the bike.</p>
<p>I ran the cable under the tank back to the battery area under the seat. This is what it looks like after connecting things.</p>
<p>

    <figcaption><p><b><i>Under seat cabling</b></i></p></figcaption>
  
</figure>
</p>
<p>You can see the shiny black cable with the in-line fuse carrier on its side coming in from the left (front). That’s going to the Oxford controller.</p>
<p>The red wire connects from a switched live I found in the small, black six-way connector that’s there, at least in 2023 Himalayans. I probed around with a multimeter until I found a switched live, then pushed the single wire in there (with a crimped connector), and folded it back, holding it in place with some black insulation tape. I did that rather than break into wiring so that I could remove this later if needed.</p>
<p>The other end of the red wire goes into that piece of bicycle inner tube which is protecting a standard automative relay and connects the battery positive to the Oxford feed wire.</p>
<p><em>For those unfamiliar with relays; A relay is simply a switch for a power feed that is controlled by a second feed. This allows high-power devices to be controlled by much smaller capacity switches. They’re widely used on all vehicles to simplify wiring. A starter solenoid is an example of a relay that prevents a very thick wire having to be run up to a very large switch controlled by a key – the key sends a small current to the solenoid which has a thick wire from the battery and allows current to flow to the starter.</em></p>
<p>This setup has worked well for me for a couple of thousand miles and should last indefinitely, but there are many ways to connect such things.</p>

</p>
<p>Perhaps not to everyone’s taste, but ammo boxes are cheap, strong and last forever. They’re easy to fit, too!</p>
<h3 id="backstory">Backstory</h3>
<p>I like to carry a few things when I’m riding. Tools, a can of tyre weld, a spare litre of fuel, a couple of cereal bars and, being English, a flask of tea. So luggage was always something I needed. However, the official RE Panniers are surprisingly expensive, so originally I fitted two £10 military surplus kit bags like so:</p>
<p>

    <figcaption><p><b><i>Himalayan with kit bags</b></i></p></figcaption>
  
</figure>
</p>
<p>These worked really well, quite roomy, no rattles and did well through the summer. But come the winter, the muck thrown up by the road made them very dirty and the contents wet, even when wrapped in plastic bags. They certainly weren’t unusable, but I fancied something else. 50cal ammo boxes are cheap and a good size, so I bought five for £30 off ebay, delivered. Good deal.</p>
<h3 id="fitting-ammo-cans">Fitting Ammo Cans</h3>
<p><strong>WARNING!</strong> This was written BEFORE ONE OF THE CANS FELL OFF!  The Ebay purchased mounts shown here were sub-standard. Not only did they rust through on the lower support arms on both sides, which failed after a few months (the metal is really thing) but one day the top weld snapped and the entire can&hellip; disappeared, along with contents.</p>
<p>First – I removed the old bags. I’ll use them again later for something, they are very useful and quite tough. That left the pannier mounts, which cost something like £24 – the European models don’t come with them fitted, nor with a Sari guard which is standard for the Indian market.</p>
<p>

<p>The boxes are 100% water and air tight (less the holes I made) and can be padlocked for security.</p>
<p>There’s no wind noise, no rattling (other than contents, but I put some thin rubber on the base inside to reduce that, and packed better). There’s no noticeable difference to how the bike rides. The only minor issue I had is the same for all hard panniers – pushing the bike means you will bump your thigh, and hoicking your leg over is a bit harder – as evidenced by the mud streak above.</p>
<p>If the storage isn’t enough, well, the front pannier mounts also have holes you can repurpose…</p>

<h1 id="improving-a-himalayan-seat">Improving a Himalayan Seat</h1>

<p>I love my Himalayan, but the seat is not its best feature. It&rsquo;s hard, strangely narrow and angles forwards. Not only giving you a numb and then increasingly painful rear end after a time riding, but also squishing your gentleman&rsquo;s equipment against the fuel tank.</p>
<p>My first attempt to fix this was the buy the genuine Royal Enfield “Touring seat” for £70.80. It&rsquo;s an easy swap – just remove the old and slip in the new. But, amazingly, I couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference! It felt exactly the same. It wasn&rsquo;t made the same; it was open underneath and there was a different mesh where it was solid in the other, but it was just as hard and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I tried with various seat-toppers. That helped a bit, as did a Sheepskin, but I needed 2 or 3 before I could ride more than an hour without a break, which left me teetering on layers of unconnected foam like the Princess and the Pea.</p>
<p>I also tried using my bicycling underwear. That was surprisingly good. Then I heard about Moto Skiveez – basically the same thing but with pads specifically for adventure riding. I bought some of those. Those were a little bit better and well made, but absolutely NOT worth the <strong>£62.50</strong> I paid for them! They are good pants, but not ten times better than basic cycling padded pants, which is what they cost. I consider Moto Skiveez to be 10% good product, 90% marketing.</p>
<p>So, figuring I might as well hack the original seat around a bit. If I messed things up, I still had the Touring seat.</p>
<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<ul>
<li>I bought a 2cm thick gel pad off Amazon for £25, watched some Youtube videos, and got to work.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion--was-it-worth-it">Conclusion – was it worth it?</h2>
<p>Yeeeess…? Probably? Maybe?</p>
<p>The seat <em>is</em> more comfortable. I&rsquo;ll ride a good couple of hours (I&rsquo;m a heavy bloke with a skinny bum so I&rsquo;ll take extra padding every time). I did still wear a sheepskin over the saddle.</p>
<p>What would I do differently? I&rsquo;m not sure the gel pad made much difference – maybe I buried it too low so its shaping qualities were lost. So perhaps if you do the same, consider your needs a little better than I did.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Update 2025: 2 years on</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst my modification <em>was</em> better than the original, it still wasn&rsquo;t ideal. I stripped everything back one rainy day and set-to again, focusing on much more foam. More! More! I&rsquo;d bought a waterproof seat cover for something else, and once I&rsquo;d added a big square of foam (from a car seat booster cushion), the original cover would no longer fit - but the extra one did. So now I finally have a comfortable seat that I can ride for 3-4 hours without feeling uncomfortable. It doesn&rsquo;t look good, but I&rsquo;d need professional help and a new properly fitted cover to achieve that. Upholstery is hard!</p>

<h1 id="villaging-with-the-himalayan">Villaging With the Himalayan</h1>

<p>I like to ride for pleasure at least once a week, but have been getting a bit bored with riding the same roads and lanes. I’m fortunate to have some beautiful countryside nearby (Dartmoor – I’m in England) but even so, it’s a bit repetitive eventually.</p>
<p>My solution to this ‘problem’ is to set myself a target – to take my Himalayan to every Village in my home county of Devon.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing this for a few weeks now – and about 40 villages. It’s going to take a while as there’s at least 450 of them.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, obviously, why not?</p>
<p>It gives me a form and structure to this hobby that I quite like.  I’m on the autistic spectrum, so planning and detailing such things is often as much fun as doing them, but enough flexibility that I can deviate if the mood takes me. Sometimes the bike tells me where it wants to go.</p>
<p>It’s showing me places and roads I would never normally ride, even though I’ve lived here for almost half a century.  Some of them are quite technical, especially slippery fords after heavy rain, and the road surface of some of our lanes are very broken, slippery and rough – not to mention many having grass growing in the middle.</p>
<p>And when I reach a village? Sometimes I’ll just ride through, sometimes I’ll stop and walk around. I always try and read the village noticeboard if there is one – it’s a hugely positive thing for ones mental health to realise that there’s a lot of little goodnesses going on every day, against the endless doom and gloom of the news cycles.</p>
<p>The Himalayan is the perfect bike for this. Nimble, agile, and light enough to do a U-turn within a lane, even when pointing downhill, if you meet something that can’t reverse, or the road’s blocked for some reason. It’s quiet enough not to upset horses or the wider public. It’s very economical, and just puts-puts from village to village.</p>
<p>I totally understand this isn’t the sort of thing most people will enjoy spending on their days off, and that’s fine!</p>
<p>How do you keep things interesting when you’re riding for pleasure?</p>
<p>

<p>After 5,000 miles and the Himalayan is pretty much perfect for me. Where they weren&rsquo;t, I made some tweaks to suit me.</p>
<h3 id="a-16-tooth-front-sprocket---16">A 16 tooth front sprocket - £16</h3>
<ul>
<li>This took half an hour to fit. Changing from the original 15t sprocket means that all the five gears are somewhat taller, but this allows for a much nicer on-road experience I&rsquo;ve found
<ul>
<li>Pros: Better economy, lower revs and vibration at motorway speeds. (RPM at 70mph drops around 600 from around 5200 to 4600)</li>
<li>Cons: Higher first gear. Can be a stretch to fit on a new chain.</li>
<li>Recommended? Yes, for all users except those who ride a lot of technical off road stretches where the lower 1st gear is most useful. Those riders may even consider a 14t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="clip-on-screen-protector---20">Clip-on screen protector - £20</h3>
<ul>
<li>A small generic clip-on screen extender. I tried the Puig screen but hated it, and the clip-on reduces buffeting enough for my 6’2″ lump.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fuelx-lite---150">Fuelx Lite - £150</h3>
<ul>
<li>The factory tuning for all modern motorbikes is very lean to meet emissions. Devices like the FuelX sit between the oxygen sensor and the ECU and change the signals to trick the ECU into delivering more fuel.
<ul>
<li>Pros: Engine runs cooler and has a stronger &ldquo;pick-up&rdquo; in revs, especially at the lower end. It&rsquo;s easily fitted and also easy to remove. (The Pro version has handlebar buttons to change maps, which require more fitment. I went with the Lite)</li>
<li>Cons: Slightly lowered economy.</li>
<li>Recommended? Yes. I didn&rsquo;t have high expectations of this, but I did immediately feel and hear the difference. It’s a small gain - maybe 1 or 2hp, but worth the relatively modest price, I think.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rear-pannier-frame---50">Rear Pannier Frame - £50</h3>
<ul>
<li>Necessary to fit saddlebags or panniers. There are many available, but fall into two camps: Official Royal Enfield, or Copy. I bought a Copy from an Indian seller on Ebay, all of whom seem to be selling the same item.
<ul>
<li>Pros: Easy to fit.</li>
<li>Cons: Terrible quality! Initially the welds looked poor, and the metal thing. Within a year, one lower strut snapped off, having rusted through from the inside. I inspected the other and found it was also about to fail, then replaced both with some flat metal I had. After that, I lost an entire 50cal Ammo can pannier complete with all contents (Tools, spares etc) somewhere on the road one day. The top weld had snapped entirely. I spent a few hours making better mounts out of angle iron - these definitely aren&rsquo;t going to fail!</li>
<li>Recommended? No!  The RE official item is probably better, but stick to branded pannier mounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sidestand-plate---5">Sidestand plate - £5</h3>
<ul>
<li>Just a little plate that bolts onto the sidestand. This keeps the bike slightly more upright, but widens the footprint to stop the bike sinking on soft ground. Happy with this.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="oxford-heated-grips---60">Oxford Heated Grips - £60</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I ride year-round and England is not a tropical country. I consider these essential on any motorbike ridden here in the grey six months of winter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: As easy to fit as they could be. Took a couple of hours, then another one to set up a relay to prevent me leaving them turned on after my ride.</li>
<li>Cons: Ensure they don&rsquo;t foul anything. I&rsquo;ve seen these fitted so they can knock the kill switch off, or even lead to a sticky throttle.</li>
<li>Recommended: Absolutely. Good value, well made, clear instructions. I use them often.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gps-mounting-bar---24">GPS Mounting Bar - £24</h3>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a bar that screws into the screen mounting bolts and provides somewhere to mount a GPS or phone. I added a Quadlock mount to it for my navigation phone.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="doubletake-mirrors---135">Doubletake Mirrors - £135</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not essential, just a bit wider than stock. I do like the OEM mirrors on the Himalayan, but even with extenders they didn&rsquo;t see past my shoulders. These are slightly better, and very tough. Well made, but probably not worth the money in hindsight - you&rsquo;re paying for the brand as much as the quality.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iridium-spark-plug-11">Iridium spark plug. £11.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don’t bother unless you need to replace the plug anyway, then it will last longer than most. And even then I’m not certain it’s worth the extra.  There&rsquo;s a lot of nonsense talked about this online about it improving MPG, smoothness. I didn&rsquo;t detect any changes whatsoever.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="50cal-ammo-box-luggage-15-for-2">50cal ammo box luggage. £15 for 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bolted onto the pannier frame. I like the look and they&rsquo;re waterproof, very strong and durable.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ebx-hh-sintered-front-pads-18">EBX HH sintered front pads £18</h3>
<ul>
<li>Himalayans are known for wooden front brakes. These do make an improvement over the original pads, but there&rsquo;s only so much pads can do. But they&rsquo;re a cheap and small improvement if you don&rsquo;t want to go down the expensive rabbit-hole of replacing the master cylinder and calipers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="replacement-rear-tyre-kenda-k761-72">Replacement rear tyre: Kenda K761, £72</h3>
<ul>
<li>The original CEAT rear wore out after about 4,500 miles. These have a slightly more aggressive tread, but both behave well on-road as and off-road as I ever go. The Kendas are wearing much better and should last 50-100% longer than the CEATs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hand-guards-13-generic">Hand guards £13, generic.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Essential in winter as they keep the hands warmer! They also do protect against brush hitting your knuckles - although I maintain that if you&rsquo;re hitting brambles and branches that hard, you should slow down to protect against the handlebar being snatched to the side!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="official-royal-enfield-touring-seat-85">Official Royal Enfield Touring seat. £85</h3>
<ul>
<li>I found this made no improvement to the comfort level at all and had just as much pain as the standard seat. I sold it on.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="puig-touring-screen-95">PUIG Touring Screen. £95</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hated this. Bendy, flexy and made head buffetting at motorway speeds even worse!  Removed and sold.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-generic-auto-chain-oiler-14">A generic auto chain oiler. £14</h3>
<ul>
<li>Spent quite a long time fitting this, then discovered it emptied all its oil overnight without being touched. Removed.</li>
</ul>
