      <description>Best of British. (At least up until 2018 when the last ‘Proper’ Land Rover rolled off the production line at Solihull. I’m no fan of the modern cars.)&#xA;Why do I like Land Rovers? Teenage boys usually have posters on their wall. Nothing unusual about, I did too. Except mine weren’t of glamour models or music bands. My 1980’s bedroom walls were covered by pictures I’d cut out of 4x4 Magazines. Mostly Land-Rovers.</description>

      <description>I’ve owned a lot of vehicles over the years. Being poor but needing to be mobile, “bangernomics” meant buying cheap and buying often…&#xA;Here’s some of them.&#xA;My first car. A 1974 Toyota 1000. Lasted me for many years&#xA;Mini. Bought for £50 in Plymouth. Started to restore it, but found it was totally rotten with newspaper stuffed into the roof corners as a base for filler. Was towed to a scrap yard</description>
