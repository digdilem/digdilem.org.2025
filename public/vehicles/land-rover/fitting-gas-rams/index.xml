    <title>Fitting gas rams to a Land Rover’s Bonnet :: Digital Dilemma</title>
    <link>https://digdilem.org/vehicles/land-rover/fitting-gas-rams/index.html</link>
    <description>Easier access!&#xA;The standard Series Land Rover bonnet has no gas or spring assist, instead using a tethered prop. Replacing it with some gas rams makes it a lot easier to lift and also allows it to lift further and higher out of the way.&#xA;Front view&#xA;The fitting is fairly simple – in this case I’ve used two fairly low powered rams (from the tailgate of a Toyota Yaris). These are mounted to a single plate fixed to the bulkhead, and onto a metal plate bolted onto one of the main ribs.</description>
