Best of British. (At least up until 2018 when the last 'Proper' Land Rover rolled off the production line at Solihull. I'm no fan of the modern cars.)

# Why do I like Land Rovers? 

Teenage boys usually have posters on their wall. Nothing unusual about, I did too. Except mine weren't of glamour models or music bands. My 1980's bedroom walls were covered by pictures I'd cut out of 4x4 Magazines. Mostly Land-Rovers. 

At work meetings, I'd noticed people drew the same sorts of things over and over. One person drew horse heads, another geometric shapes, one did only angry spiky triangles! I drew Land Rovers. I'd supressed that as I'd gotten older, but in 2018 I had some upset at work that led to a fairly dark time in my life as I dealt with depression and anxiety. As my job had spread itself into most aspects of my private life too, I wanted something constructive to occupy my time and one night it occured to me â€“ why not buy an old land rover that needs some love and fix it up?

I talked it over with my wife and she was supportive (even when she learned it would involve building a car port in front of the house!) and I started looking.
