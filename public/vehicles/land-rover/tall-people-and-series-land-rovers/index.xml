    <title>Tall People and Series Land Rovers :: Digital Dilemma - Personal Tech, Projects and Software</title>
    <link>https://digdilem.org/vehicles/land-rover/tall-people-and-series-land-rovers/index.html</link>
    <description>One problem taller people often have in old Land Rovers is they can be really uncomfortable to drive. I’m 6’2″ and with the standard seats, I would start to get bad cramp in my ankle and legs after only 15 minutes or so. The adjustment in the seat is very limited because of the cross bulkhead immediately behind the seat.&#xA;There is a relatively simple modification which gives you an inch or two extra space that doesn’t seem to be widely used, however, and is cheap and quick to do. It’s also fully reversible!</description>
