I've owned a lot of vehicles over the years. Being poor but needing to be mobile, "bangernomics" meant buying cheap and buying often...

Here's some of them. 

---------------------------
![My first car. A 1974 Toyota 1000. Lasted me for many years](toyota1000.jpeg)  

![Mini. Bought for Â£50 in Plymouth. Started to restore it, but found it was totally rotten with newspaper stuffed into the roof corners as a base for filler. Was towed to a scrap yard](mini.jpg)

![JBA Falcon. A striking kit car designed to be similar to a 1930s Jaguar SS. Used a Cortina's running gear, so a 2 litre Pinto 4-cylinder and rear wheel drive. Fun car and always turned heads](jba-falcon.jpg)

![Mitsubishi Colt GLX. Fantastic car. Powerful, totally reliable but often abused. Sold after work provided a van](colt.jpeg)

![2005 Volvo V50.  Great car to drive, effortless motorway cruiser. Sadly became unreliable and local garage had a hard time fixing it.](volvo.jpeg)

![Keep Grand Cherokee. Terrible car. 4.6l straight six that was neither powerful nor economical. I believe these were built in Spain and the quality was very low. Big panel gaps, lots of rattles. When I sold it, the rear brake hose burst during the test drive and I was forced to drop the price even lower](jeep.jpeg)

![Vauxhall Corsa. My mum's car, who sold it to me for a pound. Was ultra reliable and took me to Jersey. Given to my wife who also loved it. Died from a head gasket failure. If that was now, I'd certainly have tried to repair it myself](corsa.jpeg)

![Vauxhall Frontera. Not strictly mine, but a company car for my wife who preferred driving my Mercedes. Good car. Towed a horsebox for a charity, and also went off roading in the snow to check on their horses. Did like to set its alarm off when anyone even looked at it, though.](frontera.jpeg)

![VW Gold Mk 2. The car I took my driving test in. (Damage not caused by me!)](golf1.jpeg)

![The same cars' sad end. Apparently there'd been a smell of petrol during the few days before it caught itself on fire](golf2.jpeg)

![Datsun 180b. Yeah, I raced bangers around 1990 at Newton Abbot. Only finished two races and never won, but still a fun year](180b.jpeg)
