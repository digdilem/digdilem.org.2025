    <p align="left">This is UT´s melee weapon, meant to be the last option to defend yourself
    if you are out of ammo. If charged it can do a nice amount of damage, after 1.5secs you
    can already kill someone with 100h and the maximum 135 damage after 2 secs isn`t bad
    either. This doesn´t make up for the vulnerability while running arround with this thing
    though. Not only that it´s making very loud noises when charged, but you also have to get
    very close to hit your opponent and even with dodging this is sometimes impossible,
    especially in open areas.<br>
    The only places where the piston is a good choice as a weapon is in very tight corridors
    (like in turbine) at the top/bottom of an elevator or behind a teleporter. In a duel I
    would only use it in the last case, because you don´t take any risks behind a tele. Your
    opponent doesn´t hear you through the teleporter and you can retreat through the tele if
    he is coming from behind.<br>
    Although it´s not that useful as a weapon, I still wouldn´t play without it, because
    it´s an essential tool to reach high places. This is done by hammer jumping, something
    very similar to rocket jumping in Quake. You charge the impact hammer, point it towards
    the ground and jump while releasing it in the floor. You will jump much higher than
    normally, but always lose 54 health, so you should only use it if you have nothing to lose
    or in very important situations, like jumping up to the shield/rl in codex or getting the
    sniper rifle and heightadvantage in Liandri. To repeat it, you will ALWAYS get 54 health
    self damage, no matter how long you charged, but your impulse increases linear, so if you
    have enough time you should charge the full 2 seconds to jump as high as possible.<br>
    You should also be aware, that you are very vulnerable while impact jumping. After all it
    takes 800ms to switch to a different weapon.<br>
    Something else you can do with the impact hammer is deflecting rockets, if you use the
    secondary fire just the moment the rocket would hit you. I have never seen someone using
    this in a real game though, if you have enough time to do this, you could as well dodge
    the rocket. Besides that most rockets are aimed for the ground anyway.<br>
