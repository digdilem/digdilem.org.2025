<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>

<h3 id="about-this-website">About this Website</h3>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Digital Dilemma is a name used by it’s creator, Simon Avery, since 1990 relating to computer related services.</p>
<h3 id="early-1990s--round-corner-software--digital-dilemma">Early 1990s – Round Corner Software / Digital Dilemma</h3>
<p>I founded and ran a Shareware company that distributed cassette tapes and 3″ 178Kb disks of Public Domain / Shareware Software for the Amstrad CPC. Some of it was my own text adventures, but mostly other peoples. Back then, this was the standard way to distribute software that wasn’t on sale in the local shops. People would request some titles, I’d copy them to either cassette tape or 3&quot; floppy Disks for the Amstrad CPC and post them off in a jiffy bag, charging around £3 a disk full. It was never meant to make money, just to cover the postage costs.</p>
<h3 id="early-1990s-to-around-2005--digital-dilemma-bbs-also-fidonet-225590-and-22550">Early 1990s to around 2005 – Digital Dilemma BBS. Also Fidonet 2:255/90 and 2:255/0</h3>
<p>When I first upgraded my 1200/75 modem to a 14.4kbps one, I started to run a BBS. This required renting a dedicated phone line from BT (not a cheap thing back then). It was fun to listen to the click of the modem when it answered a call and then go and see what the user was doing. Whether they were downloading files, playing one of the Door Games like Lord of the Green Dragon, or reading messages.</p>
<p>I eventually got further into messaging and ran a point system from another BBS. From there, I applied and was granted my own node number, 2:255/90 (UK, Regional Southwest). Fidonet mail was generally sorted into different topics and each downlink would require an archive created containing the mail topics they’d subscribed to, plus any direct email (called netmail) for them or their users. Because every phone call was chargeable, this was optimised and automated to be as efficient as possible. Highly compressed files created ready to be collected and even with the low linespeeds of the day, a typical send and receive would be done in a few seconds. We don’t need that level of efficiency nowadays, with fast, always-on connections. I still have some software I wrote to help this available here.</p>
<p>There were also multiple other mail networks, many specialist-interest or more lax than Fidonet’s rather stuffy rules – topics were always moderated and kept on-topic. (With the exception of CONTROV, a lawless wild place!) I forget the name of many of them now – but Landnet was one, and Blush Response ran its own network, BlushNet and I&rsquo;m still in touch with many from there even now.</p>
<p>Sometimes around 2000, the main UK Mail Coordinator, John Burden, retired through ill health and I took over the role. He had run a Midnight Line to bring mail into the UK and send it out to other countries. A Midnight Line was a product sold by BT where, for an hour a day, phone calls anywhere were not directly charged. Instead, you paid a fixed fee and I understand that was considerable.</p>
<p>By that time, ISDN was available for home use and Digital Dilemma had BT&rsquo;s Home Highway product, which allowed for 2x 64kbps simultaneous, bonded connections (for the cost of two phone calls!). This was much superior for data transfer as not only was it faster than the fastest 56kbps modem, there was no lengthy modem negotiation. ISDN connected within 1 second and  the entire call was often over by the time a modem had finished connecting - which was important when you were paying by the second!</p>
<p>Eventually, Fidonet throughput trickled away as people moved onto the internet and sometime around 2005 when it was only getting 2 or 3 calls a day, I closed Digital Dilemma, cancelled Home Highway and managed to get an always on ADSL connection at 512/128 kbps.</p>
<h3 id="websites">Websites</h3>
<p>The first Digital Dilemma website appeared on the internet around 1995 as a free btinternet site. I didn&rsquo;t register the <code>digdilem.org</code> domain until 2001.(Verifiable by Whois)</p>
<h3 id="then-to-now">Then to now</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s 2025 and I&rsquo;ve been publishing a personal website for around thirty years.</p>
<p>The method has changed, such as;</p>
<ul>
<li>Hand written HTML</li>
<li>Dreamweaver HTML</li>
<li>Wordpress on a VPS</li>
<li>Jekyll hosted on Github</li>
<li>Wordpress hosted via Cloudflare Tunnel on my home server</li>
<li>In this latest iteration, Hugo hosted by Cloudflare pages</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s no formal company, product or service attached to Digital Dilemma. I use digdilem as a nick in a great many places and I’ve generally provided this site, in some form or another, mostly to house a few projects and share some information.</p>
<p>I hope this site is useful in some small way.</p>

  <em>An old geek from Dartmoor</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a labourer, tree surgeon, van driver, maintenance worker, fundraiser and managing director of a horse charity.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m a Linux Sysadmin happily working for a Sports company in Exeter, England.</p>
<p>I have always been a geek, and fairly recently self-diagnosed as Autistic. This follows an early formal diagnosis of Dyslexia. Re-evaluating my life with this information has led to a lot of &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; moments&hellip;</p>
<h4 id="programming-and-computer-experience">Programming and computer experience</h4>
<ul>
<li>1980s: <strong>BASIC, Quill, Adlan, GAC</strong> <em>A fun time and the 8-bit Text Adventure scene in Britain at that time was lively and exciting. I sold several games, mostly through WoW Software. (RIP Joan)</em></li>
<li>1990s: <strong>TADS, Borland Turbo-C</strong>  <em>I ran a BBS for over a decade, and much of my C coding was developing tools for that.</em></li>
<li>2000s: <strong>Perl, PHP, Bootstrap, SQL</strong> <em>At this point I was asked to write a database to manage the horses for our family&rsquo;s equine charity. This evolved into a major CRM that grew with the charity until it was managing close to a thousand horses, 150 staff and all the inter-relationships. This was written entirely in Perl CGI, using MySql as a backend</em></li>
<li>2010s: <strong>Bash, Python, lots more perl and SQL</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the late 90s, I made a major career change and was lucky enough to get a job with a great employer as a Linux Sysadmin. All my adult life I&rsquo;d lived in awe of these super beings, and suddenly I was one. Imposter syndrome was huge and the learning curve was steep!</p>
<ul>
<li>2020s: Linux, specialising in EL (Centos, RHEL, Rocky), Debian. MariaDb administration. Uyuni. Grafana. PRTG. Zabbix. Docker and the dozens of other stacks that sysadmins need to know.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="hobbies">Hobbies:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DIY, land maintenance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Home Automation, mostly using a very large and completely unnecessary Home Assistant setup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walking, Cycling, Geocaching <em>Since some heart trouble, this is now less</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Motorcycling with the occasional easy green lane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vehicle maintenance and restoring old vehicles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a <a href="https://github.com/digdilem" rel="external" target="_blank">Github page</a></p>
</li>

<p>I maintain a number of <a href="/dartmoor/index.html">Dartmoor related websites</a></p>
